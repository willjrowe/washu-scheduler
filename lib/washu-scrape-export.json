Some contend that memory sites are \"the new lunch counters,\" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice. Through our study and engagement with contested commemorative landscapes, including local, national, and global cases, students will become familiar with the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of memory studies, diverse forms and sites of commemoration, local and global efforts to advance what has been termed \"commemorative justice,\" and challenges they face.",

How does the racial governance of the 21st century upend or echo the racial governance of the colonial era? How does this new era affect our understanding of race and identity?

        "Course Description": "Nearly fifty percent of Africa's population now lives in urban areas. By 2050 this number is expected to triple to 1.23 billion or what will then be sixty percent of the continent's total population. This urban growth is happening alongside rapid economic expansion, technological innovations, and-in some cities-political insurrection. Many of these developments are taking place in peripheral urban areas that lack formal planning, basic infrastructure, and security.  Yet, as many theorists point out, the very lack of cohesive planning and stable infrastructure in urban Africa has produced flexible spaces where novel forms of dwelling, work, and leisure are possible. Many residents, often by necessity, rearrange their built environments to make the city function beyond the limits of its original design. In the process, urban dwellers produce new built spaces, aesthetics, and economic practices, calling into question assumptions about what a city is and how it works. What are the implications of Africa's urban revolution for both the people who inhabit these cities and the world at large? How will Africa's urban future shape what some theorists are calling \"the African century?\" What can contemporary cities across the continent tell us about the future of urban life everywhere? In this seminar, we will explore these questions by surveying a variety of case studies and topics from across the African continent. The purpose in focusing on Africa in general is not to homogenize an incredibly diverse continent, but to make connections across a variety of different contexts in order to explore conceptual debates and assemble a theoretical tool-kit that is useful for grappling with themes that are simultaneously abstract and concrete.",

        "Course Description": "Whom do we trust to tell us when something is a classic novel, album or film? Professional critics? Fan reviews? Academic analysts? How is such acclaim, or denunciation, determined? Indeed, the stakes of these questions are heightened when critique is directed at works produced by African-Americans. In this course we will consider these and other questions by reading/viewing/listening to a series of canonical African American cultural texts across mediums (e.g., Lorraine Hansberry's Raisin in the Sun, Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, Barry Jenkins' Moonlight and, assuming next year's offerings are anywhere as good this year's, an exhibit at the St. Louis Arts Museum). Upon initial read/listen/view students will work through methods of close reading of primary texts and provide their own critical review. Next, students will be tasked with employing a fieldwork method to consider how each text was critically received (a different fieldwork method will be required for each text we consider): 1. Using library resources to locate critical receptions in digital archives, i.e., newspapers, journals, etc., 2. Interviewing folks for their critical receptions or memories of the text, and 3. For a more contemporary text, students will engage in an ethnographic approach. In turn, students will use their findings as primary data to be used towards a final paper, blog, or various other potential final project presentations. Beyond engaging with canonical works and multidisciplinary methods this course would introduce students to the various ways that black cultural production, as a whole, is critically received: What type of expectations are set? Where are these works consumed and reviewed? What kind of language is consistently used by critics? etc. This will aid students in gaining a sense of their own subjectivity in relation to their subject matter.",

Indeed, Baldwin saw himself as a \"public witness to the situation of black people,\" compelled to speak truth to power in whatever form he deemed necessary. Baldwin as: black, gay, man, American, author, activist, and so much more, has served as an essential figure in theorizing alterities of the presumed rigidity of these very concepts. In this respect, this course will center Baldwin the thinker as much as Baldwin the author. We will examine his classic novels and essays as well as his work across many less-examined domains - theatre, sermon, dialogue, film, short story. Moreover, while committing ourselves to close reading methods, we will situate Baldwin's works within socio-historical context and consider how he shaped, and was shaped by, events beginning with the Civil Rights Era through our precarious contemporary moment in which he remains, often tragically, a timely voice.",

We will then look at four instances of African Americans running for president: comedian and activist Dick Gregory in 1968, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in 1972, and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988.  Of course, a number of black people have run for the presidency as third-party candidates: Frederick Douglass, James Ford, Lenora Fulani, Cynthia McKinney, Angela Davis, and Eldridge Cleaver, among others.  And some have sought the Republican Party's nomination as conservatives such as Alan Keyes, Herman Cain, and Ben Carson.  Some of these will be mentioned briefly discussed but time will not permit us to study them.  We are fortunate that Dick Gregory and Shirley Chisholm wrote firsthand accounts of their campaigns.   \nWe will then move to the heart of the course: an examination of United States Senator from Illinois Barack Obama's successful campaign for presidency as the first black nominee of a major party.  We will consider his career before he became president as well as exam some aspects of his presidency itself.  It is hoped that this course will offer students a new understanding of the American presidency and some exposure to how black people have thought about this office as a cultural symbol and a realization of power.",

How do we best document the past with students fully at the intellectual table of production and preservation? How do we make history with history?

How does race - more specifically blackness - alter these conversations, inscribing greater fears about criminal behaviors?  This course taps into this reality examining the varied ways people of African descent have been and continue to be particularly imagined as a distinctly criminal population.  Taking a dual approach, students will consider the historical roots of the policing of black bodies alongside the social history of black crime while also foregrounding where and how black females fit into these critical conversations of crime and vice.  Employing a panoramic approach, students will examine historical narratives, movies and documentaries, literature, popular culture through poetry and contemporary music, as well as the prison industrial complex system. The prerequisite for the course is L90 3880(Terror and Violence in the Black Atlantic) and/or permission from the instructor, which will be determined based on a student´s past experience in courses that explore factors of race and identity.

As the global epidemic rages on, our greatest enemy in combating HIV/AIDS is not knowledge or resources, but global inequalities and the conceptual frameworks with which we understand health, human interaction, and sexuality.  This course emphasizes the ethnographic approach for cultural analysis of responses to HIV/AIDS.  Students will explore the relationship between local communities and wider historical and economic processes, and theoretical approaches to disease, the body, ethnicity/race, gender, sexuality, risk, addiction, power, and culture.  Other topics covered include the cultural construction of AIDS and risk, government responses to HIV/AIDS, origin and transmission debates, ethics and responsibilities, drug testing and marketing, the making of the AIDS industry and \"risk\" categories, prevention and education strategies, interaction between bio-medicine and alternative healing systems, and medical advances and hopes.",

Students will work with public databases, visit local museums, and comb local archives in an effort to recover what we can of the industry of enslavement in St. Louis, to map it onto the streets of contemporary St. Louis, to document slave ownership on maps of St. Louis County, and, to the extent possible, to begin to recover what we can of the lives of individual persons enslaved in St. Louis county. After being introduced to the available resources that we will use to tackle these different projects, students assign themselves to teams tackling each. Over the course of the semester, we will also read background literature on the history of enslavement in the Americas, slave narratives, autobiographies, and biographies, and histories of the St. Louis region while sampling online and video resources as appropriate. We will also read literature on the place of historical, archival, and digital work in shaping our public engagement with this past and envisioning a collective future in light of it.",

How does race - more specifically blackness - alter these conversations, inscribing greater fears about criminal behaviors?  This course taps into this reality examining the varied ways people of African descent have been and continue to be particularly imagined as a distinctly criminal population.  Taking a dual approach, students will consider the historical roots of the policing of black bodies alongside the social history of black crime while also foregrounding where and how black females fit into these critical conversations of crime and vice.  Employing a panoramic approach, students will examine historical narratives, movies and documentaries, literature, popular culture through poetry and contemporary music, as well as the prison industrial complex system. The prerequisite for the course is L90 3880(Terror and Violence in the Black Atlantic) and/or permission from the instructor, which will be determined based on a student´s past experience in courses that explore factors of race and identity.

This Ampersand course investigates how perceptions, representations, and meanings of the American Dream have changed throughout history-and how they live on in the contemporary United States. Rather than seeking definitive definitions or answers, we carefully and thoughtfully examine case studies of American culture and the arts-literature, theatre, film and painting-as the lens for understanding images of nation and identity. Utilizing an intimate seminar format to facilitate close reading and discussion of works in various media, this Ampersand course emphasizes both critical thinking and writing-and also requires students to execute a creative project of their own making as well. We also visit a variety of exciting performances and exhibits, both on and off-campus. Our primary goal is a compelling, interdisciplinary perspective on the American Dream, one that synthesizes the arts, performance and politics. This course is intended for first-year students; any seats remaining after first-year students enroll are open to other classes.\n\n",

However, for complex reasons, their presence has either been concealed, or dismissed through dangerous stereotypes, or just as inaccurately, celebrated for proving the generosity of American liberalism and multiculturalism. Racially misrecognized, this large and heterogeneous group has nonetheless shaped American categories of race, sexuality, and citizenship in intriguing and powerful ways. South Asian Americans have reached to fiction, music and popular culture to craft deeply intimate and original assessments of mainstream desires. In doing so they have sought to resist the dictates of whiteness, to question US imperialism, to garner acceptance and mobility, to build solidarity with other US minorities. In this course we learn about the complex history and cultural productions of South Asians in America. How did \"South Asia\" become a category of identification, and who benefitted from that designation? What role have South Asians played in the economic, cultural and global ascendancy of the United States? How do South Asians connect with, and control, their countries of origin? What is the significance of story-telling in building the archive and questioning the fiction of South Asian America?",

Du Bois's African American culture exists \"behind the veil,\" gay men and women come in and out of \"the closet,\" terrorists lie hidden in \"sleeper cells\"-these are just a few of the common visual metaphors used to describe the complex forces and subjects that make up U.S. culture.  Despite its status as metaphor, however, visuality shapes our relationship to American society in very real ways. To become visible in the eyes of the state is to access citizenship, to become a full member of the social world. In this course, we will encounter a variety of cultural texts that figure identity through visibility. From narratives of haunting in U.S. culture to spectacular displays of national identity and accounts of minority groups insisting on the right to be seen, we will look to the moments in American culture when the question of visibility has been most crucial.  The course is arranged thematically and will feature both primary texts as well as classic and contemporary work in the field of American Studies. Possible topics include: the theory and practice of Holy Land tourism in the nineteenth century; antebellum hoax culture; the relationship between lynching and mass media; documentary accounts of natural disasters from the San Francisco earthquake to Hurricane Katrina; queer representation in popular media; the rise and fall of the Vine app; the rhetoric of terrorist \"sleeper cells\"; oppositional mythologies of the \"white working class\" and \"undocumented\" immigrants. The semester will culminate with a discussion of the globalization of American Studies alongside a serial viewing of the first season of the acclaimed drama series, Homeland (2011).\n\nAmerican Culture Studies (AMCS) is a multidisciplinary program that provides both a broader context for study in different fields and a deeper understanding of American culture in all of its complexities.",

We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures? Students unfamiliar with these sacred canons will gain a familiarity with their contents and cultural contexts, while those who already know one or more of them will inevitably discover new insights into their inter-relationship and subtle, often startling contents.",

        "Course Description": "What does it mean to do American culture studies? This course teaches students how to critically analyze U.S. culture and society and introduces them to the history, methodologies, frameworks, and key questions that have shaped and continue to inform this interdisciplinary field. American culture studies is a broad and vast discipline that defies simple summary; it asks probing questions to uplift marginalized voices and experiences as part of an expansive definition of American identity. This course exposes students to practices that constitute American culture studies rather than demarcate a terrain for what it is: historically crossing disciplinary boundaries (arts, humanities, social sciences) and engaging diverse texts (film, literature, historical documents, popular culture, performance, material culture, etc.) American culture studies resists strict definition!  In this course students study how knowledge and understandings about society and culture are produced and learn approaches to analyzing, curating and interpreting cultural objects and theorizing cultural phenomena. We examine the concept and idea of \"America\" in local, regional, national, and international contexts and continuums; we explore the lived experiences of diverse American communities within and across cultural and literal borders. Through a case study approach, the course engages questions related to the construction of ethnic and racial identities in the U.S.; visual, material, and digital cultures; social thought and social issues; mass media and popular culture; gender and sexuality; citizenship and nationhood; art, literature, and performance; and American imperialism.",

A selection of texts from various disciplines (including history, the social sciences, music, literature, and the arts) inform our class discussions. Over the course of the semester, we also engage with scholarly conversations about constructions of \"Latinidad\" as they relate to questions of identity, class, race/ethnicity, religion, gender, im(migration), language, and popular culture. Students learn to recognize and appreciate the complexities of Latino/a experiences in the United States and will become familiar with a critical vocabulary that facilitates complex discussions about broader issues of American culture and identity.\n Prerequisite: Freshmen members of the Annika Rodriguez Scholars Program.

The course is organized in three parts. Part I surveys the late 19th and early 20th century development of the \"parental state\" including its institutional centerpiece (the juvenile court), and principle legal subjects (\"dependents\" and \"delinquents\"), and how these took shape alongside the contemporaneous rise of American Apartheid. Part II examines several key changes and challenges in contemporary juvenile justice, including the transformation of this institution in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, and the endurance of racialized juvenile social control in the post-Civil Rights period. Finally, Part III considers possible futures of youth justice in the United States and beyond, and practical strategies for achieving equal protection within and beyond law.",

        "Course Description": "The presence of Muslim minorities in the West is increasingly divisive across the US and Europe as political leaders appeal to voters' fear of the 'Other' to promote Islamophobic agendas that reshape immigration and asylum policies and redefine Western identity as Christian. Politicians further exploit the rise of extremist groups like ISIS to justify anti-Muslim rhetoric and critique multiculturalism, claiming that Islam and the West are inherently antithetical. In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century. We also analyze public US debates on the boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.",

It examines as well strategies for dealing with many of the profound social issues affecting urban/metropolitan America.  Emanating from an historical perspective, it examines the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization shaped Northern American cities and the consequences of deindustrialization on urban citizenry. It further surveys the demographic and spatial transformation of American cities examining the consequences of urban transformation on federal, state and local politics, on society and on her institutions. Similarly, the course focuses on the origin and societal changes and emerging goals of urban development, gentrification and evolving patterns of metropolitanism and the necessity for central city as well as neighborhood reconstruction. The dynamics of racial residential segregation, crime and punishment, issues of academic achievement and under-achievement, the social cleavages of urban marginalized communities, family structure, urban homelessness, urban sprawl, and health care, among others, are viewed from the perspective of social justice by exploring social, political, economic, racial, and ethnic factors that impact on access, equity and care. Various theoretical perspectives and philosophies are introduced that have dominated the discourse on race and urban poverty.  A field based component complements the coursework, and is designed to build interest, awareness and skills in preparation for outreach to urban communities.  PREREQUISITE: Sophomore standing.",

Following a rough chronology, the course centers African American musicians as creators and innovators of a vast range of music forms that make up the foundations of contemporary popular music in the United States and across the globe. We will consider the following questions: Does popular music in America merely entertain us, or does the music we listen to do something more and touch upon issues in our lives? Can it do both simultaneously? Can popular artists influence politics, or is that too much to ask of them?In order to address these and other questions, we will interrogate how musicians, performers, scholars, listeners, and consumers experience, participate in and think about various music and dance practices, from slave music and minstrelsy, the blues, jazz, and rock and roll to reggae and hip hop. Historically and through the present, we will consider how African American musicians, as well as musicians and performers from other underrepresented groups, have so often been excluded from reaping the economic and political benefits of music industries, and how they have contested injustice on multiple levels. This means that our core questions ask what musical practices can reveal about relations of race, gender, class and belonging in this country. Readings are drawn from the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music studies, and dance studies. Prerequisite: Music 121 or permission of instructor.\n",

We read the news and examine current affairs as they unfold week by week, critically analyzing and exploring modes of understanding, historicizing, and contextualizing contemporary issues in American society. The course introduces students to theoretical and conceptual frameworks for this engagement and asks questions such as: How are these issues related to the past? How have Americans experienced this issue before? And how is the contemporary context different? We'll follow trends in pop culture, technology, politics, and society. Students learn to layer current issues with historical documents, the commentary of public intellectuals and cultural critics, and political, economic, and social policies. The course stresses research analysis, group process, critical thinking, multidisciplinary inquiry, and professional writing and speaking skills.

        "Course Description": "In the months after 9/11, President Bush urged Americans to buy cars and take vacations to show their patriotism and unity, and also to send a message to terrorists that \"our way of life\" could not be stolen.  Such calls to consume have often been made in times of crisis, and consumption has long been something of a national pastime (some would say a national pathology!).  But frugality, simple living, and ethical consumerism have also at-times been declared American values, and are now just as likely to be advanced by celebrities, entrepreneurs, or corporations as by political activists.  This multidisciplinary course explores our complex and evolving relationship to materialism and materiality, focusing on moments in U.S. history when consumption has been especially consoling or haunting, or been aligned with ideas of the public good or social and political change.  Along the way, we will study material goods that have been declared symbols of American values (soap, Tupperware, Harley-Davidson motorcycles, #MAGA hats); influential advertising campaigns and models of \"good\" and \"bad\" consumer behavior (shoplifting, hoarding, \"good housekeeping,\" thrifting, etc.); and anti-materialist positions from Thoreau's Walden to the Occupy Movement to today's \"off-the-grid\" cooperative-living communities.  Students will write short analytical response papers, conduct a study of their own consumer practices, and do a final project on a recent \"ethical consumption\" campaign in historical perspective.  \n\nThis course counts as \"Multidisciplinary\" for AMCS students, and as \"Visual Culture\" for Sam Fox students.\n\n\nVariable topics course for courses best suited to the Visual, Digital, and Material Culture concentration area in American Culture Studies.",

After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series´ departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy. Authors will include Newbery, Alcott, Montgomery, Wilder, Lindgren, L'Engle, and \"Carolyn Keene.\"  Writing Intensive. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

        "Course Description": "Starting with Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind,\" a book that helped re-ignite the Culture Wars, this course will consider the debates and problems that pervaded American culture during the 1990s. From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's \"The Human Stain,\" Jonathan Franzen's \"The Corrections\") and popular films (Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" and The Cohen brothers' \"The Big Lebowski\") to personal memoir and the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history. Other possible texts include David Foster Wallace's \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" Joan Didion's \"Political Fictions,\" Toni Morrison's \"Paradise,\" John Updike's \"Rabbit at Rest,\" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's \"Prozac Nation.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

        "Course Description": "Most legal practice consists not of fine oratory but rather of great writing. However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.

        "Course Description": "This course takes morality and the question of \"what's right\" seriously as a lens through which to understand and assess modern American history. \"Morality\" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be \"good,\" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. Yet \"good\" is a contested concept, especially in a diverse, multiracial society. Thus this class examines a) how state and non-state actors, including religious leaders, have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and b) the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. To what degree does calling something moral or immoral articulate or obstruct policy solutions? What do political coalitions oriented around \"values\" accomplish? Is it possible to hew to moral frames and remain inclusive and tolerant? Topics may include marriage, abortion, immigration, alcohol, incarceration, disease, money, and medical care.",

In this course, we participate in this national project of history-making by helping to excavate the queer past in the greater St. Louis region. Course readings will focus on the ways that sexual identities and communities in the United States have been shaped by urban settings since the late nineteenth century, with particular attention to the ways that race, class and gender have structured queer spaces and communities. We will pay particular attention to these processes in the St. Louis region. As part of their community-engaged learning, students will complete an oral history interview with a St. Louis LGBTQ+ community member and otherwise contribute to preserving  LGBTQ+ history in the St. Louis region.  We end the semester with a party celebrating the folks who have contributed to our oral history project.  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a community-engaged learning class, which means it combines classroom learning with work in the community. In addition to regular class time, plan to spend an additional 3-5 hours a week on community-engaged learning. Before beginning community service students must complete required training. Prereq: Intro to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies or Intro to Queer Studies, or permission of instructor.",

        "Course Description": "In 2014, Bansky, the urban street artist, painted a mural of three government agents flanking a public telephone booth, each using spy gadgets to listen, record, and transmit a copy of the conversation had within. His work reflects the emergent concerns of citizen surveillance in western democracies and the techno-logics of twenty-first century political reality where persistent monitoring, invisible identification, and data collection are features of both government control and data-driven capitalism. Rise in technological sophistication both in the capture and assessment of data makes adoption at scale by city governments affordable and relatively non-controversial. But as the surveillance of bodies, habits, associations, and identities becomes more naturalized in the governing and policing institutions of urban areas, legal safeguards lag behind, concepts like privacy and security become fuzzier, and existing inequalities of race and class become hardcoded in the techno systems supposedly designed as neutral tools. This fieldwork class will explore St. Louis as a landscape of the always observed, from community-level realities to online experiences. Readings and class discussion will be complimented by field trips to sites in the St. Louis region to interrogate the practice of observation in situ among different zip codes and communities where the blanketing presence of surveillance practices and surveillance technology warps a relationship to place, amplifies racial, cultural, and class inequalities and disenfranchisements, consolidates social and political control, and replaces human accountability with the veneer of the objective and rational machine.",

This course explores the wealth of immigration narratives produced in the twenty-first century in order to investigate what characterizes U.S. immigration for this generation. Through an archive of contemporary novels, poetry, film, visual art, and music, we will examine the different strategies immigrants to the United States use to tell their stories and how those stories are impacted by national origin, race, gender, and class. From Lulu Wang's multigenerational tragi-comedy The Farewell to Valeria Luiselli's borderland essay Tell Me How It Ends, we will search for connection and contrast among different kinds of immigrant journeys, experiences, and art forms. This course is open to students at all levels who are willing to think deeply and creatively about the materials we study. Artists examined will include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jhumpa Lahiri, Shaun Tan, and Jose Antonio Vargas. \n\nAmerican Culture Studies (AMCS) is a multidisciplinary program that provides both a broader context for study in different fields and a deeper understanding of American culture in all of its complexities.",

We will investigate the voice's role in diverse forms of individual and group singing, how voice relates to technology and media, and how the diva archetype becomes applied to singers and vocal genres. A wide range of academic literature, media texts, and listening examples will be used to develop interdisciplinary and intersectional analyses of voice.

How is such acclaim, or denunciation, determined? Indeed, the stakes of these questions are heightened when critique is directed at works produced by African-Americans. In this course we will consider these and other questions by reading/viewing/listening to a series of canonical African American cultural texts across mediums (e.g., Lorraine Hansberry's Raisin in the Sun, Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, Barry Jenkins' Moonlight and, assuming next year's offerings are anywhere as good this year's, an exhibit at the St. Louis Arts Museum). Upon initial read/listen/view students will work through methods of close reading of primary texts and provide their own critical review. Next, students will be tasked with employing a fieldwork method to consider how each text was critically received (a different fieldwork method will be required for each text we consider): 1. Using library resources to locate critical receptions in digital archives, i.e., newspapers, journals, etc., 2. Interviewing folks for their critical receptions or memories of the text, and 3. For a more contemporary text, students will engage in an ethnographic approach. In turn, students will use their findings as primary data to be used towards a final paper, blog, or various other potential final project presentations. Beyond engaging with canonical works and multidisciplinary methods this course would introduce students to the various ways that black cultural production, as a whole, is critically received: What type of expectations are set? Where are these works consumed and reviewed? What kind of language is consistently used by critics? etc. This will aid students in gaining a sense of their own subjectivity in relation to their subject matter.",

        "Course Description": "How do the most oppressed members of society challenge and sometimes overturn the status quo? Since the sixteenth century, the profitable exploitation of African-descended enslaved people drove the European colonization of the Americas in territories ranging from Virginia to Jamaica and Brazil. While enslaved people had always resisted their conditions, the institution of slavery received the most sustained challenges from below in the form of large-scale revolt and everyday resistance during the so-called \"Age of Revolutions\" (c. 1760-1830) that rocked the Atlantic world-American, French, Haitian, and Latin American. We will examine how members of the African diaspora shaped the major social, political, and cultural developments of this pivotal era in modern history through a variety of topics and themes: the significance of enslaved resistance and revolt in the creation of early American societies; the spread of news, rumor, and revolutionary ideas throughout the African diaspora; the development of racial ideologies in Enlightenment thought and culture; the emergence of abolitionist movements; and, the origins and influence of the Haitian Revolution on other slave societies, in particular the U.S. and Cuba. Students will complete this course with a strong grounding in critical and interdisciplinary historical methodologies, including in the use of cutting-edge online digital humanities resources. Students also will have the opportunity to produce historical scholarship themselves through writing an original research paper. Finally, we will consider the legacies of early Black freedom struggles to the modern Civil Rights Movement and to contemporary political concerns such as Black Lives Matter and the debates over reparations for slavery.",

Indeed, Baldwin saw himself as a \"public witness to the situation of black people,\" compelled to speak truth to power in whatever form he deemed necessary. Baldwin as: black, gay, man, American, author, activist, and so much more, has served as an essential figure in theorizing alterities of the presumed rigidity of these very concepts. In this respect, this course will center Baldwin the thinker as much as Baldwin the author. We will examine his classic novels and essays as well as his work across many less-examined domains - theatre, sermon, dialogue, film, short story. Moreover, while committing ourselves to close reading methods, we will situate Baldwin's works within socio-historical context and consider how he shaped, and was shaped by, events beginning with the Civil Rights Era through our precarious contemporary moment in which he remains, often tragically, a timely voice.",

        "Course Description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from any academic discipline (and with any post-graduate plans) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding the conduct, mode of analysis and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the extent of a landlord's (or university's) duty to prevent criminal assaults on its tenants (students), groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, the use and abuse of class action lawsuits, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. Prerequisite: sophomore standing or higher. It is most definitely not a prerequisite to be intending or even thinking about going to law school.\nNo more than two excused absences during the semester.",

        "Course Description": "This course (formerly called \"Women and the Law\") explores how social constructions of gender, race, class, and sexuality have shaped traditional legal reasoning and American legal concepts, including women's legal rights.  We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty.

We read one of the best selling novels of the century, one that created a scandal and ruined the author's literary reputation, along with others that have garnered more attention in our time than their own.  In addition to focusing on these women writers, we also explore questions about the canon and American literature:  What makes literature \"good\"?  What constitutes American literature?  How does an author get in the canon and stay there?  Finally, in this writing intensive course, there are frequent writing assignments and a strong emphasis on the essential writing process of drafting and revising.",

How does race - more specifically blackness - alter these conversations, inscribing greater fears about criminal behaviors?  This course taps into this reality examining the varied ways people of African descent have been and continue to be particularly imagined as a distinctly criminal population.  Taking a dual approach, students will consider the historical roots of the policing of black bodies alongside the social history of black crime while also foregrounding where and how black females fit into these critical conversations of crime and vice.  Employing a panoramic approach, students will examine historical narratives, movies and documentaries, literature, popular culture through poetry and contemporary music, as well as the prison industrial complex system. The prerequisite for the course is L90 3880(Terror and Violence in the Black Atlantic) and/or permission from the instructor, which will be determined based on a student´s past experience in courses that explore factors of race and identity.

But just how did Americans themselves go about creating the world's largest and most successful democratic republic?   And how democratic was this violent new nation that reeled from one crisis to another, and ultimately to the brink of collapse in its first seventy-five years?  This survey of American history from the creation of the Republic to the eve of the Civil War explores the Revolution and its ambiguous legacies, the starkly paradoxical \"marriage\" of slavery and freedom, and the creation of much of the America that we know; mass political parties; a powerful Presidency; sustained capitalist growth; individualistic creeds; formalized and folkloric racism; heteronormative patriarchal family life; technological innovation; literary experimentation; distinctively American legal, scientific and religious cultures; and the modern movements of labor, feminism, and African-American empowerment.

        "Course Description": "From the beginning of the human campaign, societies have socialized the spaces and places where they live.  This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

        "Course Description": "\"We the people\" is one of the most familiar refrains in American cultural and political life. But who is the \"we\" and who are the \"people?\" The founding documents of the U.S. issue forth a dispiriting paradox: \"the people\" are both the source of the democratic impulse as well as a narrowly construed category, one that excluded great swaths of the populace, including women, enslaved people, and indigenous people. \n \nThis course will use the theories and methods of performance studies to explore questions of American populism in media, politics, and art. Is populism a political orientation? Or is it a style that one enacts? What does it mean to claim that one acts on behalf of \"the people?\" Is all political behavior \"political theatre?\" \n \nWhile the November 2020 U.S. presidential election will undoubtedly play a major role in our inquiry, we will think cross-culturally and historically about performances of populism by both leaders and the people whom they claim to represent. Topics to be explored might include: the singing of anthems, the fandom of team sports, and the many ongoing attempts to fulfill the promise of \"we the people\" by those engaged in the black freedom struggle, movements for gender equality, and indigenous rights movements.\n\n\n A Writing Intensive course, AMCS 375A serves as an occasion for students to think about matters of argument and presentation, as well as the methods and models that will serve future research.  Students should expect to do a lot of writing and reading, and to produce a series of shorter assignments that culminate in a final multidisciplinary project-proposal.  \n\nThis course is intended for students at the Junior Level or Higher; it fulfills the \"multidisciplinary\" (MD) requirement for AMCS Minors and the \"Methods Seminar\" requirements for AMCS Majors.

The course explores these themes through in-depth case studies, including common psychopharmaceuticals, the evolution of HIV/AIDS medications, lifestyle drugs, performance enhancers, and overprescription and addiction, among others.

Dada's emergence in Zürich and New York in the midst of the First World War set the tone for its stress on irrationality as an oppositional strategy. Surrealist research into the domain of the unconscious continued this extreme challenge to dominant culture, but in a revolutionary spirit that proposed new possibilities for personal and collective liberation. The international character of the movements, with substantial cross-transmission between Europe and the United States, will be emphasized.

It focuses first on how he understood himself and foregrounds his inspired conception of his own world-historical role in the Civil War.  The course also traces how the larger world furnished the contexts of Lincoln's career, how his consciousness, speeches and writings, and presidential decisions can be understood against the backdrop of the revolutionary national democratic upheavals of the 19th century.  Finally the course will investigate how the sixteenth president, so controversial in his day, has remained a site of cultural contestation, with historians, novelists, poets, cartoonists, filmmakers, advertisers, and politicians struggling over his memory and meaning, to the present.",

Other topics covered include the cultural construction of AIDS and risk, government responses to HIV/AIDS, origin and transmission debates, ethics and responsibilities, drug testing and marketing, the making of the AIDS industry and \"risk\" categories, prevention and education strategies, interaction between bio-medicine and alternative healing systems, and medical advances and hopes.",

Beginning with Wharton's reimagining of national and gender identity in \"The House of Mirth\" (1905) and \"The Age of Innocence\" (1920), we will read Stein's \"Three Lives (1909); Cather's \"My Ántonia\" (1913) and \"Sapphira and the Slave Girl\" (1940); Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937); and selected poems by Marianne Moore such as her satire \"Marriage\" (1923). Modernist literary women tried to imagine freer social roles for themselves, their characters or personae, and their readers. But to what extent was biographical and social experience aesthetic fate, and how does nostalgia function in this period? There will be a midterm paper, a final paper, and a formal oral report. Faithful attendance and class participation are required, naturally! Graduate students will have extra responsibilities, to be discussed at our first class meeting.

We will also investigate how the lens of dance and choreography offers an expansive means to conceptualize political questions of citizenship and social protest, broadening our understanding of embodied performance. Guided by several key philosophical texts, our class will focus on concepts necessary to examining the convergence of performance and politics (such as representation, ritual, spectacle, body, mimesis, propaganda, etc) while also paying special attention to the politics of funding and censorship that has governed the creation and presentation of dance in the United States. No dance experience is necessary.",

The purpose of this course is to explore the process of (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions influence pedagogies-especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge; (3) how pedagogies translate into specific school programs and practices; (4) how these programs and practices impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities influence ideologies and power dynamics. In doing so, this course considers a variety of key educational institutions and actors at the local, state, and federal levels. This course also considers politics across time, space, and individuals-noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. Additionally, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work towards the common good. Specifically, we explore stories that demonstrate how politics can influence the lived experiences of individuals from various class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identity groups. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e. \"What went wrong?\") to problem solution (\"Where do we go from here?\").",

        "Course Description": "This seminar focuses on two contrasting currents within American and European modernism between the two world wars: native and cosmopolitan. Alternating between the U.S. and France, it begins in the years before World War I and concludes with the rise of virulent forms of cultural nationalism in the late 1930s. We consider the subjects, personalities, aesthetic strategies, and political and social investments associated with these alternative modernisms, linked to a search for roots, on the one hand, and on the other, to a desire for forms of spatial and social mobility. Comparing 'homegrown' and expatriate experience, we will consider divergent attitudes toward identity, gender, nation, time, and nature, analyzing these two fundamental responses to modernity in relation to one another.  Prereqs:  Intro to Western Art (L01 112) or Intro to Modern Art (L01 211); one 300-level course in Art History preferred; or permission of instructor.",

        "Course Description": "How can I develop a stronger sense of academic identity and purpose? How can my research translate into opportunities beyond the classroom, from service to politics? In this workshop AMCS Majors explore these questions while receiving support at a crucial milestone, the Senior Capstone. Through reflection and writing students develop a stronger intellectual identity, and consider how their research prepares them to participate in conversations and activities that transcend scholarship. We think about this participation as a kind of \"academic citizenship\": students leveraging their learning to engage intellectual, social, and political life in and beyond campus. Students do this primarily through consideration of their capstone research, happening concurrently in the AMCS Capstone Workshop or in an approved seminar. While encouraging Majors to consider the intersection of their academic and personal goals, the workshop supports research (e.g., guest faculty discuss methodology), gives structure to activities already required for the Major (e.g., the capstone abstract), and builds community (e.g., peer-led discussions). The workshop also provides time and space for students to curate their AMCS portfolio.  \n\nThe Fall Workshop is part of a one-credit workshop series designed to help AMCS Majors develop their portfolio and provide additional training and support at particular milestones in the major. The portfolio and accompanying workshops is a response to students' feedback.  Graduating seniors tell us they would have liked more structured time to reflect on their work in the major; they would have liked to document their progress in the program more fully; and they wanted more opportunities to strengthen their class cohort. The Fall Workshop will provide all of those things, while centering students' attention on their growth as scholars and engaged citizens.",

American history courses normally begin with the colonization of the New World by Europeans beginning in the 15th century, sometimes with a cursory chapter dedicated to the 20,000 years of history that came before.  This class will invert this structure and place what we normally think of as American history in the context of a much longer story by drawing on sources from many disciplines, including archaeology, ethnography, ecology, geology, linguistics, and oral history.  We will focus on a contested events or issues, where our sources tell different stories, and consider what is at stake for defenders of different narratives.  Throughout the course, we will ask how the lack of written records limits our understanding of North American history, but also how other sources of evidence about the past can be used to include populations and themes normally underrepresented by textual histories. The goals of this course are 1) to put recent American history in its proper context; 2) to show how historical narratives are constructed and contested; and 3) to give students tools other than written records with which to construct history.

Beginning with the earliest human occupations in the region more than 12,000 years ago, this course examines how domestication, urbanization, the rise of early states, and major technological inventions changed life in the Andes from small village societies to the largest territorial polity of the Americas - the Inca Empire. Students will become familiar with the major debates in the field of Andean archaeology. Together, we will examine archaeological evidence (architecture, art, ceramics, metals, textiles, plant and animal remains, etc.) from context of everyday life (households, food production, craft production) to the rituals and ceremonies (offerings, tombs) that took place in domestic and public spaces. We will also touch on the role of Andean archaeology in the context of national politics and heritage sustainability.",

        "Course Description": "The COVID-19 Pandemic has severely impacted life on Earth, and in the USA, in particular. New information is released daily to a public that is often unable to interpret the meaning or significance. How are individuals, groups, businesses, and/or governments interpreting this information? What impact does it all have on our lives? This course will be an immersion into the many intersecting aspects of life in a pandemic. The first section of the course will focus on the virus and illness itself: the scientific classification, possible treatments and vaccines, testing, safety measures, at-risk groups and health outcomes for different groups, and understanding the numbers. This section will incorporate lessons on how to interpret and evaluate scientific information, how the information gets communicated to the public, and how it gets incorporated into policy. The second section will start to integrate connections to society at large, including health disparities, understanding how environmental destruction and agricultural systems are related to disease outbreaks, global connections, racism and COVID-19, and variation in effectiveness of dealing with the virus in different countries. The final section will cover how the pandemic intersects with different aspect of our lives from finance to law, mental health, education, domestic violence, the arts, and on and on.  You will hear experts in these areas talk to us about how COVID-19 has changed virtually every aspect of life as we know, how we can mitigate these effects, and what the future looks like. Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to hone your skills at communicating the information you learn in the class with the public.\n\nNote: This course is a Fall Intersession course and it will be included on your FL2020 schedule.

        "Course Description": "What do the opium poppy, the white willow tree, spoiled sweet clover, Madagascar periwinkle, and the fungus Penicillium have in common? Each of these species contains biochemicals that have been tapped to \"advance\" medicine. Biodiversity prospecting (\"bioprospecting\") is often understood as the systematic search for biochemical and genetic information in nature, in order to develop commercially valuable products for pharmaceutical, agricultural, cosmetic and other applications. Contemporary medical innovation depends on bioprospecting to remain \"cutting edge,\" but what are the human and ecological costs of this rapidly changing industry? This course explores the social, political, and environmental impacts and ethical implications of the global search for new biological resources. We will study the role of indigenous knowledge, the problem of biopiracy, the politics of intellectual rights, and patenting culture in our quest to understand what is at stake in the regulation, reform, and growth of this problematic indicator of public health, biotechnology, and historical and \"modern\" medicine in the global economy.",

The ancient Maya were the only Pre-Columbian civilization to leave us a written record that we can use to understand their politics, religion, and history.  This course is about Maya ancient history and Maya glyphic texts, combined with the images of Maya life from their many forms of art.  The combination of glyphic texts, art, and archaeology now can provide a uniquely detailed reconstruction of ancient history in a New World civilization.",

This course will challenge you to reconsider the meanings of \"global\" and \"local\" by introducing new social scientific approaches to studying the key problems that have connected (and dis-connected) diverse human populations throughout the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries: growing disparities in material wealth, natural resource depletion, energy over-consumption, inequitable access to care, and beyond.",

        "Course Description": "From the beginning of the human campaign, societies have socialized the spaces and places where they live.  This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

        "Course Description": "This course will explore the rise of civilization in the broad region of Eurasia, spanning from the eastern edges of Europe to the western edges of China.  The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250).  In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

The course will use the latest version of ESRI ArcGIS. The course is taught using a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on, interactive tutorials in the classroom. You will also explore the scientific literature to understand how GIS is being used by various disciplines to address spatial questions. The course takes a multidisciplinary approach that is focused on learning the tools of GIS versus working with data from a particular field. The goal is to establish a solid foundation you can use to address spatial questions that interest you, your mentor, or your employee. The first weeks of the course will provide a broad view of how you can display and query spatial data and produce map products. The remainder of the course will explore the power of GIS with a focus on applying spatial analytical tools to address questions and solve problems. As the semester develops, more tools will be added to your GIS toolbox so that you can complete a final independent project that integrates materials learned during the course with those spatial analyses that interest you the most. Students will have the choice of using a prepared final project, a provided data set, or designing an individualized final project using their own or other available data.",

Amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, the sense that life is in crisis is unmistakable. As we are seeing across the world, the designation of crisis mobilizes support, calls for transnational collaborations, demands swift and steadfast action. This course explores the work that \"crisis\" does in anticipating and implementing health interventions. We will address the following questions: How is crisis conceptualized and experienced by various actors and stakeholders? How do the responses of governments and international agencies align or conflict with local and indigenous responses to crisis? In what ways do vulnerable populations face a disproportionate burden of crisis, and what does this reveal about the social contrasts of societies? In this advanced undergraduate and graduate seminar, we will consult full-length ethnographies, long-form journalism, and podcasts to examine a variety of contemporary and recent crises concerning environmental degradation and toxicity, migration and displacement, and infection and chronic illness in a variety of geographic settings, including the United States, China, Sierra Leone, Nicaragua, and Uruguay.",

Special emphasis is placed on diet, nutrition, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology and stable isotopic analysis in archaeology, however student will gain a sound awareness of a wider range of approaches and techniques that are widely used in other sub-disciplines, and how these may be utilized to investigate past societies and cultural landscapes. The lab component will help students to acquire hands on experiences and skills as the basic foundations of scientific applications, the ability to know why, what and where to sample on an archaeological site for environmental and scientific analyses, what kinds of information are forthcoming and how to critically assess these types of data.

        "Course Description": "Today, people often see animals as pets, even members of the family, or as food. Relationships with wild animals are diminishing in many places as populations move to the cities, and relationships between people and animals vary widely. In this seminar we use current articles and seminal anthropological and evolutionary literature to examine ways that changing human-animal relations influenced humans over the long term. Social distances between humans and our nearest relatives have increased over the last 4 million years with dramatic turning points 12,000 and 300 years ago, but biological distances are less marked. Here we explore a range of key issues through time starting with the history of western conceptual divisions between humans and animals, which contrast with more fluid boundaries in other world regions. We will also examine hunting and symbolic relations with wild animals relying on data from ancient animal bones, art and texts. Domestic animal partnerships are a focus of much of the course, starting with dogs and moving to pigs, sheep and cattle and to transport animals, donkeys, horses and camelids. Birds including chickens, turkeys and ostriches may also be a focus of research. We will examine the role of animals in human thought including religion and folklore and discuss current and future human-animal relationships. One of the goals of the course is to provide an overview of ways that animals have influenced human life, rates and patterns of change in human society and long-term perspectives on human life in the 21st century.",

Through ethnography, anthropologists do more than simply describe a culture or a group of people; rather, they organize and present their field materials in particular ways in order to make intellectual, theoretical, and sometimes even political arguments.  This seminar will explore the different ways anthropologists have used ethnography to make intellectual claims and frame theoretical or practical arguments.  The aim of the course is to help students develop critical reading skills for engaging ethnographic materials as well as to explore the ways in which ethnography, when done well, can be a persuasive and engaging means of academic argumentation.

As the global epidemic rages on, our greatest enemy in combating HIV/AIDS is not knowledge or resources, but global inequalities and the conceptual frameworks with which we understand health, human interaction, and sexuality.  This course emphasizes the ethnographic approach for cultural analysis of responses to HIV/AIDS.  Students will explore the relationship between local communities and wider historical and economic processes, and theoretical approaches to disease, the body, ethnicity/race, gender, sexuality, risk, addiction, power, and culture.  Other topics covered include the cultural construction of AIDS and risk, government responses to HIV/AIDS, origin and transmission debates, ethics and responsibilities, drug testing and marketing, the making of the AIDS industry and \"risk\" categories, prevention and education strategies, interaction between bio-medicine and alternative healing systems, and medical advances and hopes.",

Anthropologists and sociologists study institutions through ethnography, the close study of everyday interactions, albeit also incorporating approaches from politics and economics, and largely shaped by the traditions of social pragmatism.   We explore the theoretical and empirical dimensions of an ethnographic and pragmatist approach through readings of Goffman, Foucault, and Bourdieu, and of more recent analyses of schools, courtrooms, immigration police, science laboratories, art, and other institutions.",

        "Course Description": "From the beginning of the human campaign, societies have socialized the spaces and places where they live.  This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

This course, taught in English, connects to the mission of UNESCO and examines the wide range of theoretical and research issues, both historical and current, related to reading and writing across languages and cultures. Literacy acquisition among second language learners involves a number of variables including both cognitive and social factors. Topics to be discussed in class include universal cognitive operations, individual learner differences, text types and literary forms, literacy and social power, and the extent to which reading and writing are interrelated. Students will discuss how to bridge scientific research in the laboratory to practice and will be involved in St. Louis community outreach projects with refugees and immigrants at the International Institute, where they will create and implement reading and writing activities driven by theory and empirical investigations. Students will take the theory and research they learn and will help meet the local reading and writing needs of a changing population with a variety of backgrounds, values and educational preparations.

        "Course Description": "Tensions between center and periphery; migration and rest; power and powerlessness; exile, home, and return are easily found in the historical record of both Jews and Muslims. For Muslims, it can be said that it was the very success of Islam as a world culture, and the establishment of Muslim societies in in all corners of the globe, that lay at the root of this unease.  But the disruptions of the post-colonial era, the emergence of minority Muslim communities in Europe and North America, and the recent, tragic flow of refugees following the Arab Spring have created a heightened sense of displacement and yearning for many.  \n \nOf course, the very term \"diaspora\"-from ancient Greek, meaning dispersion or scattering-has most often been used to describe the Jewish condition in the world. The themes of exile and return, catastrophe and redemption, are already woven into the Hebrew Bible and continued to be central motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity and the middle ages.  This, despite the fact that more Jews lived outside the borders of Judea than within the country many years before the destruction of Jewish sovereignty at the hands of the Romans. In the twentieth century, European imperialism, nationalisms of various types, revolution, and war-including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict-have done much to underscore the continuing dilemmas of Diaspora and home in both Jewish and Islamic identity.  \n \nThe goal of this course is to offer a comparative, historical perspective on the themes of migration and displacement, center and periphery, home and residence, exile and return, and to give students the opportunity to examine in depth some aspect of the experience of \"Diaspora\".\n\nNote: This course fulfills the capstone requirement for Jewish, Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. The course also counts as an Advanced Seminar for History. (Students wishing to receive History Advanced Seminar credit should also enroll in L22 491R section 19 for 1 unit.)

        "Course Description": "From the beginning of the human campaign, societies have socialized the spaces and places where they live.  This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250).  In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

Dada's emergence in Zürich and New York in the midst of the First World War set the tone for its stress on irrationality as an oppositional strategy. Surrealist research into the domain of the unconscious continued this extreme challenge to dominant culture, but in a revolutionary spirit that proposed new possibilities for personal and collective liberation. The international character of the movements, with substantial cross-transmission between Europe and the United States, will be emphasized.

Lines to experience the sensation of being rained on without getting wet ranged up to seven hours at times. This merging of new technology with the gallery space proved irresistible, but also raises questions as to the uses of technology in contemporary art, and whether or not this could be much more than a gimmick. As one Yelp reviewer put it, \"The Rain Room is definitely an experience.Let's be honest... I'm mostly upset that I didn't get a cool, new Facebook profile pic out of it.\" This course will consider technological developments in modern and contemporary art, from photography, video and new media, digital and Internet art, as well as forays into new technology that blur the lines between art and science.

This seminar examines the origins of the palace, its construction in early Ming, the coded symbolisms of its plan and decoration, the rituals of court, and the lives of its denizens, from emperors (including Pu Yi, the \"last emperor\") to concubines, from Jesuit missionaries to eunuchs.  The course also considers the twentieth-century identity of the site as a public museum and the backdrop to major political events, as well as its role in the urban design and contemporary art of twenty-first century Beijing.

        "Course Description": "This seminar focuses on two contrasting currents within American and European modernism between the two world wars: native and cosmopolitan. Alternating between the U.S. and France, it begins in the years before World War I and concludes with the rise of virulent forms of cultural nationalism in the late 1930s. We consider the subjects, personalities, aesthetic strategies, and political and social investments associated with these alternative modernisms, linked to a search for roots, on the one hand, and on the other, to a desire for forms of spatial and social mobility. Comparing 'homegrown' and expatriate experience, we will consider divergent attitudes toward identity, gender, nation, time, and nature, analyzing these two fundamental responses to modernity in relation to one another.

Picasso was a leading figure in the European primitivist trends at the beginning of the last century, and with Georges Braque, he developed the aesthetic system of Cubism, which rewrote the rulebook of artistic representation.  Although he was not an activist, his art routinely engaged momentous political events. Toward the end of his career, he strove to shape his legacy through artistic dialogues with artists of the past by appropriating their styles or subjects, and making them his own. Such eclectic activity, coupled with his creativity and prolific output, has ensured his place among the most influential artists of his century.

This seminar will examine his art and literature in three sections: the first devoted to studying the art itself throughout his short career; the second, devoted to the mythologies surrounding his art and its relationship to such notions as genius and madness. Third, we will look at how his art has become a popular commodity, reproduced internationally by methods varying from precise painted replicas to commercially popular goods marked with his most famous paintings. The history and theory of modern commodity culture on a global scale and its intersection with a burgeoning art market for post-impressionist art will be explored in this final section.\nPrerequisites: L01 113 or L01 215 and one advanced course in art history, or permission of the instructor",

Artists, documentary photographers, and filmmakers alike are tasked with conveying the complexity of these issues to a wider public, mediating between environmental theories of human and nonhuman connection, the decolonial project and human inequalities, and the encoded values of the historical landscape genre. This course will cover the history of 19th-century\nlandscape and its legacy today, the 1960s Land Art movement and its relationship to modern environmentalism, and the nuances of contemporary eco art. In addition, we will go in-depth into some of the most prolific media within eco art, including photography and film, and explore the contemporary debates specific to these fields.\nFinally, the course concludes with propositional texts from artists and theorists about the future of our planet and our species within it.\nPrerequisites: L01 113 (Intro to Western Art) plus one 300-level Art History course",

The social, ethnic, and religious diversity, and the political and gender-related complexities of the Vietnamese are typically neglected. By focusing almost exclusively on Vietnam, US narratives of the war also tend to gloss over the wider regional dimensions of the conflict. In the interest of redressing this imbalance, this course examines the outlook, values, agency, and experiences of northern and southern Vietnamese, as well as rural and urban Cambodians and Laotians. Drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary sources it provides a macro and micro level historical analysis of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos from the premodern era until the present. In so doing, it explores the early sociocultural foundations of ancient Southeast Asian civilizations, the impact of Chinese and French colonialism, and Japanese occupation, the rise of Indochinese nationalist and communist revolutionary movements, the process of decolonization, the impact of U.S. military intervention, the rise and fall of the Khmer Rouge, postwar political and economic developments, and the memories and multiple meanings of the Vietnam Wars for Southeast Asians.

        "Course Description": "South Asians have always played an integral role in the culture, history and politics of the United States. However, for complex reasons, their presence has either been concealed, or dismissed through dangerous stereotypes, or just as inaccurately, celebrated for proving the generosity of American liberalism and multiculturalism. Racially misrecognized, this large and heterogeneous group has nonetheless shaped American categories of race, sexuality, and citizenship in intriguing and powerful ways. South Asian Americans have reached to fiction, music and popular culture to craft deeply intimate and original assessments of mainstream desires. In doing so they have sought to resist the dictates of whiteness, to question US imperialism, to garner acceptance and mobility, to build solidarity with other US minorities. In this course we learn about the complex history and cultural productions of South Asians in America. How did \"South Asia\" become a category of identification, and who benefitted from that designation? What role have South Asians played in the economic, cultural and global ascendancy of the United States? How do South Asians connect with, and control, their countries of origin? What is the significance of story-telling in building the archive and questioning the fiction of South Asian America?",

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

        "Course Description": "This course is designed to familiarize undergraduate students with the fascinating lives of plants, their evolution, their remarkable structural and morphological diversity, how they grow, and how they have been modified to feed the planet. Topics include: how plants can survive with just water, minerals and light, how they transport water astonishing distances, their unusual sex lives, why they make seeds, how they can grow nearly forever, how plants survive extreme environments without running to hide, why they synthesize caffeine, nicotine, THC and opiates, how they defend themselves from pathogens without an immune system, how they sense their environment without dedicated sensory organs, how plants have been modified by humans to provide food, fiber and fuel, and how genetically modified (GMO) crops are made and their implications to the environment and society. Overall goals are to enhance an understanding and appreciation of the plant kingdom, to help young scientists understand the primary scientific literature, and as a starting point for possible careers in plant biology. Class includes field trips to the Missouri Botanical Gardens and a local plant biotech company/institute.  Where appropriate, the class will also emphasize key differences between plants and animals. This course is primarily for first-year students interested in majoring in biology, with a possible emphasis on plants. This course is also for those that want to know more about where their food comes from, how these amazing creatures survive and flourish, and how GMO crops are engineered. Upper-level students with an interest in food and sustainable agriculture but not necessarily focusing on plants will also be welcome. Course will be lecture/discussion/hands-on format for 2 of the 3 hours per week. Students will present 20-minute papers discussing topics relevant to their interests for the remaining 1 hour (two students per class). Prerequisites: Students must have taken both biology and chemistry in high school and at least one at the AP or IP levels; or have taken Bio 2960 or Chem 111/112. This course can be taken by both first-year and upper-level undergraduates with a preference given to first-year students.",

        "Course Description": "\"Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide.  In spite of focused research efforts, cancer still poses a unique biomedical puzzle as it is now recognized that cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of many disorders with underlying mechanistic complexities that can affect most tissues in the human body.  This interactive 1st-semester course provides an introductory overview of the biology, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.  We touch upon background topics in DNA structure and replication, gene regulation and transcription, protein synthesis, mutations and DNA repair, but the primary focus is on the genetic and molecular changes that normal cells undergo during transformation into malignant cancer cells, emphasizing the dysfunction of essential biological processes like programmed cell death, cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune surveillance.  Classical diagnosis and treatment methods are compared with newer strategies, such as targeted therapies.  Finally, the growing role of \"\"omics\"\" technologies in tumor classification, patient prognosis, and therapy are discussed.  The course is a mix of lectures, student-led discussions/presentations, guest seminars and activities.  Lectures provide an overview of each topic, while activities and discussions of cutting-edge oncology topics in the news and primary literature familiarize students with current trends in cancer research/treatment as well as enhance reading and critical analysis skills.  Students choose a specific type of cancer for further study and near the end of the semester prepare a presentation to the class on its molecular and cellular etiology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and current/future treatment options.  Midterm Exams, which attendance is required, will be administered on Wednesday, September 23, 6:30 - 8 pm & Wednesday, October 28, 6:30 - 8 pm.\nPrerequisite: High school biology and chemistry, while completing AP or Honors biology is highly recommended.  Enrollment is restricted to first-year students in the \"Hallmarks of Cancer & Patient Care\" program.\nGrade Options: Credit, Pass/Fail\n\"\n",

In addition to weekly lecture and discussion, students in this class will visit sites across the state during 3 weekend camping trips and 2 one-day trips.  Attendance on field trips is an essential component of the course. Course enrollment is open only to students admitted into the Pathfinder Fellowship program.",

        "Course Description": "MedPrep I (Bio 2651) is a unique, interactive lecture series taught by the central subcommittee chair on the Washington University School of Medicine admissions committee. Through a weekly 2-hour lecture, this course gives students accurate, honest, and detailed information on how to become the most competitive applicant to medical school. This course is particularly helpful for freshman and sophomores in that it helps students plan their time in college. It reviews common pitfalls encountered by unsuccessful applicants to medical school and outlines every step of the application and admissions process. The entire educational path including medical school and residency is also included. Students also have the opportunity to talk with current medical students and resident physicians about their life in medical school and residency, respectively. MedPrep I is a prerequisite for MedPrep II (Bio 2654), the shadowing course that takes place in the Charles F. Knight Emergency and Trauma Center of Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the main teaching hospital for the Washington University School of Medicine. There is no outside coursework and no exams, so this course can be taken with the busiest of course schedules. For the Fall 2020 semester, MedPrep I will be taught fully remote and taught synchronously via Zoom. Class attendance is required. A $10 course fee applies.

        "Course Description": "Introduction to Environmental Biology is designed to teach important principles of environmental biology and general science literacy skills. We cover the foundational biological principles and contemporary issues within four main topics: human population growth, transfer of energy and carbon in the ecosystem, biodiversity, and food production. We focus on the biological principles involved as we examine these topics in the context of some contentious and confusing issues related to environmental biology in everyday life. The science literacy skills that you master in this course will help you address the issues you face in your everyday life regarding scientific and pseudoscientific claims about the environment and society and will form the foundation for your development as a critical consumer of science information in the media. This course is required for all environmental biology majors and environmental studies minors. We recommend you take this course in your first- or second-year if possible. If your interests align and your schedule allows, we recommend co-enrolling in ENST 215: Introduction to Environmental Humanities.\n\n\n\n",

        "Course Description": "This course explores the costs, benefits and constraints that drive the evolution of animal behavior. It is divided into four modules that cover a range of common empirical and numerical tools in modern evolutionary biology (no prior experience in any of the following topics is necessary). MODULES: (1) a brief overview of basic statistics and a tutorial in R; (2) an experimental lab on agonistic behavior in crickets; (3) a computer simulation lab on the evolution of animal communication; and (4) a phylogenetic comparative analysis lab exploring the topic of sexual selection. Laboratory modules are hands-on and student driven. They begin with an overview of relevant literature and a discussion of key questions that have been addressed experimentally in that field. Students are then encouraged (and guided) to apply these concepts into the design, execution, and analysis of individual and/or collaborative research projects. In the process, they learn how to apply some of the latest numerical and/or empirical research tools in evolutionary biology. A majority of class time is devoted to active learning through the collection and analysis of data (each lab module lasts 4 weeks). The course also includes weekly presentations by the instructor and class discussions on topics that help place the students' work into the broader context of evolutionary theory.

What new scientific stories can we hear about ecology or evolution? What makes up these fields anyway? The seminars are often followed by receptions which are a chance to get to know each other better and to ask questions. This course invites undergraduates to listen to these presentations and write about them. After all, this is a major part of the ideas climate at Wash U. It would be a great idea to get in the habit of going to seminars, with this course, or without it. In addition to attending seminars, we will meet three times during the semester, early on and a couple of times later. When: Most seminars are 4:00 on Thursdays, though some are on other days. The three meetings will be arranged at a time that works for the students in the course. Small class. No final. Credit 1.0 units\n",

        "Course Description": "The goal of this course is to help students in the CCSN Pathway develop the critical thinking skills necessary to develop and implement high quality, interdisciplinary research projects.  Throughout the course of the semester, each student will develop a research plan in their chosen area of interest.  The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course.  The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing.  For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work.  The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals).  Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback on the development and implementation of research aims.  The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions.  Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments.  The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods.  The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods.  Feedback, didactic work, and group discussion throughout the semester will include guidance on critical components of the development of a research plan, including how to perform literature searches, formulate testable hypotheses, write critical literature summaries, and design experiments and analyses.  The course will meet once a week, with faculty members from different tracks within the Pathway present at each meeting.  This will allow students to receive feedback from several perspectives.

Understanding the links between brain and behavior requires an understanding of cognition-the computations performed by the brain, as well as the algorithms underlying those computations and the physical substrates that implement those algorithms. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the tools, concepts, and techniques for the experimental study of cognition and behavior in humans and nonhuman animals. We will focus on cognitive capacities that are well-developed in humans and can be compared with those of other species, to develop an understanding of how evolution shapes cognition and behavior. Students who complete this course will be able to ask questions and form hypotheses about the computations and algorithms underlying cognition and behavior, and to design experiments that test these hypotheses.

        "Course Description": "This course traces the development of chemistry from early atomic theory to modern descriptions of structure, bonding, and intermolecular interactions. Over the course of the semester, the students learn how macroscopic observations of stoichiometry, chemical reactions, the properties of elements and compounds, and chemical periodicity developed into the microscopic understanding of molecular structure and bonding. The semester begins with fundamentals related to stoichiometry, chemical reactions, solution chemistry, and gas properties, with an emphasis on quantitative problem solving.  The octet rule, Lewis structures, and valence-shell-electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory are then introduced as early efforts to describe the stability and structures of molecules.  The localized electron model (LEM) and molecular-orbital theory (MOT) are next described as modern descriptions of chemical bonding.  The course concludes with intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This course will be a serious introductory series that requires and develops algebraic-computation and problem-solving skills. \nPre-requisite: Two years of high-school math, and one year of high-school chemistry or physics, or by permission of the instructors.  Students who register for Chem 105 are required for one of the subsections. Exams will be given on Tuesdays, October 20th, November 17th and December 15th. All exams will be administered online. The exact time window for each mid-term exam will be announced at the beginning of the semester. Details about online exams will be announced a week before each exam. \n",

The goal is to provide students with a sampling of current research activities dealing with fundamental an applied problems in science and society that are being approached from a chemical point of view.  Students will see how fundamental chemical principles can be obtained from experiment and theory and used to both better understand and make better the world we live in.  Each week a different scientist presents a lecture or offers an additional activity.  Intended primarily for freshman who anticipate majoring in science, but interested upperclass students should also find the lectures interesting and simulating.  Students are expected to attend all lectures and associated activities during the semester. Credit/No Credit only. Course is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

        "Course Description": "This seminar is intended for first year undergraduates to learn about the role that chemistry can play in addressing one of the greatest challenges we face: climate change. Chemistry has played a vital role in providing the energy needs of society, and advances in chemistry can help to develop abundant and economically viable energy technologies that do not have adverse consequences on the environment. Chemistry has long been central to the use of fossil fuel, and there remain opportunities to improve the efficiency of fossil energy resources thereby contributing to lower carbon dioxide emission per unit of energy generated. Importantly, chemistry is critical to the development of renewable energy resources, especially, solar energy for the generation of electricity and fuels. Material covered will include the challenges associated with meeting the world's increasing energy needs while reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. This class will cover the role of chemistry in energy technologies, including storage of energy.",

Whether in North Africa with the Arab Spring, in West Africa with university strikes, or in East Africa through a linguistic full bloom, youth have been shaping social responses to societies for a long period.  In this course, we will study social structures, including churches, NGOs, developmental agencies as well as learn about examples of Muslim youth movements, and the global civil society.  The course will also explore how youth impact cultural movements in Africa and how they influence the world. In particular, we will examine Hip-Hop movements, sports, and global youth culture developments that center on fashion, dress, dance, and new technologies. By the end of the course, students will have enriched ideas about youth in Africa and ways to provide more realistic comparisons to their counterparts in the United States.

Part I surveys the late 19th and early 20th century development of the \"parental state\" including its institutional centerpiece (the juvenile court), and principle legal subjects (\"dependents\" and \"delinquents\"), and how these took shape alongside the contemporaneous rise of American Apartheid. Part II examines several key changes and challenges in contemporary juvenile justice, including the transformation of this institution in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, and the endurance of racialized juvenile social control in the post-Civil Rights period. Finally, Part III considers possible futures of youth justice in the United States and beyond, and practical strategies for achieving equal protection within and beyond law.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines the social and developmental experiences of children and adolescents at the national and international level. Readings will focus on the development of children and adolescents from historical, sociological, psychological, and political perspectives. Students will examine how both internal and external forces impact the developmental stages of children and adolescents. Students will investigate the issues that impact children and adults such as poverty, war, media, schooling, and changes in family structure. Students will explore some of the issues surrounding the education of children such as the effects of high quality preschool on the lives of children from low income families and the connection between poverty and educational achievement. Students will focus on the efficacy of the \"safety nets\" that are intended to address issues such as nutrition, health, violence, and abuse. Throughout the course, students will review and critique national and international public policy that is designed to address the needs of children and their families throughout the educational process. \n",

Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series´ departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy. Authors will include Newbery, Alcott, Montgomery, Wilder, Lindgren, L'Engle, and \"Carolyn Keene.\"  Writing Intensive. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

        "Course Description": "This course will approach the history, culture and literature of Nazism, World War II and the Holocaust by focusing on one particular aspect of the period-the experience of children. Children as a whole were drastically affected by the policies of the Nazi regime and the war it conducted in Europe, yet different groups of children experienced the period in radically different ways, depending on who they were and where they lived. By reading key texts written for and about children, we will first take a look at how the Nazis made children-both those they considered \"Aryan\" and those they designated \"enemies\" of the German people, such as Jewish children - an important focus of their politics. We will then examine literary texts and films that depict different aspects of the experience of European children during this period: daily life in the Nazi state, the trials of war and bombardment in Germany and the experience of expulsion from the East and defeat, the increasingly restrictive sphere in which Jewish children were allowed to live, the particular difficulties children faced in the Holocaust, and the experience of children in the immediate postwar period. Readings include texts by Ruth Klüger, Harry Mulisch, Imre Kertész, Miriam Katin, David Grossman and others. Course conducted entirely in English. OPEN TO FIRST YEARS.

A collaboration between the East Asian Languages and Cultures and Performing Arts departments, this course explores Chinese cultural narratives in relation to how they have been performed--on stage in traditional forms of dance-drama, on screen in film, and as lived in the practice of everyday life--from the late Imperial period to the present. It includes a practice component introducing the students to movement disciplines such as Tai' Chi and opera, and allows students to pursue creative assignments such as interview, stage plays, and filmmaking that demonstrate their developing knowledge of historical and contemporary Chinese culture. Building bridges of understanding between the United States and the Republic of China in Taiwan, the course will culminate in a spring break trip to Taiwan.\n* This course is only for first-year, non-transfer students in the Ampersand: Encountering China program.\n",

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

Coptic was the vernacular language spoken and written in Egypt during the Roman, Byzantine, and Arab periods (until about 1300 CE) and as such is important for studying the history of pre-modern Egypt. It preserves some of the oldest known translations of the Bible, many apoc­ryphal and \"heretical\" books that illustrate the wide diversity of ancient Christianity (e.g., the Gospels of Thomas and Mary), as well as sermons, saints lives, monastic instructions, and liturgical manuals that still constitute the literary culture of the Coptic Orthodox Church today. In addition, a plethora of \"magical\" papyri illustrate medical and religious practices; personal letters reveal the lives of everyday people; and hordes of business documents (contracts, wills, governmental petitions, receipts, etc.) have proved important for understanding Roman and Byzantine economies. As Roman Egypt was a highly bilingual society, there are even instances of Classical Greek literature translated into Coptic (e.g., selections of Homer and Plato), which offer a unique witness to how such texts were received by Egyptians. Our goal this semester is to cover fifteen of twenty lessons in the grammar book. The remainder will be covered in the second semester.",

        "Course Description": "Ideas about sex and gender have not remained stable over time. The ancient Greeks and Romans had their own ideas - ideas that strike us today as both deeply alien and strikingly familiar. This course will consider questions such as: what constituted \"normal\" sex for the Greeks and for the Romans? What sex acts did they consider to be problematic or illicit, and why? What traits did the Greeks and Romans associate with masculinity? With femininity? How did society treat those who did not quite fit into those categories? How did peoples of the ancient world respond to same-sex and other-sex relationships, and was there an ancient concept of \"sexuality\"? How did issues of class, ethnicity, and age interact with and shape these concepts? How does an understanding of these issues change the way we think about sex and gender today? We will read an array of ancient texts in translation, consider various theoretical viewpoints, and move toward an understanding of what sex and gender meant in the ancient world.",

Yet Cleopatra was also a formidable military strategist, a powerful leader who studied medicine and spoke nearly a dozen languages. Most importantly, Cleopatra was the prototype for depicting strong women on the throne. This course will explore how Early Modern writers re-imagined Cleopatra in the Renaissance, a time which saw another strong queen, Elizabeth I, rise to power. We will pay special attention to how writers used Cleopatra to engage with Early Modern issues of globalization, gender, history, and politics. Finally, we will think about how Shakespeare and his contemporaries contrasted the exotic and sometimes scandalous Cleopatra with the virginal Queen Elizabeth. Readings may include works by Cicero, Lucan, Plutarch, and Virgil from antiquity; and plays by Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Daniel, Brandon, Elizabeth Cary, Fletcher, Dryden, and Shakespeare as well as the writings of Queen Elizabeth from the Renaissance.  3 short responses; midterm and final papers; and a presentation introducing one of the assigned readings. First-year and/or students with no prior knowledge of this topic are encouraged to enroll. Satisfies the Early Modern requirement.",

        "Course Description": "Magic is perhaps not one of the first words one associates with Greco-Roman antiquity. Yet for most individuals living in the ancient Mediterranean, including philosophers, businessmen, and politicians, magic was a part of everyday life. Casting spells, fashioning voodoo dolls, wearing amulets, ingesting potions, and reading the stars are just some of the activities performed by individuals at every level of society. This course examines Greco-Roman, early Christian, and Judaic \"magical\" practices. Students read spell-books which teach how to read the stars, make people fall in love, bring harm to enemies, lock up success in business, and win fame and the respect of peers. Students also look at what is said, both in antiquity and in contemporary scholarship, about magic and the people who practiced it, which helps illuminate the fascinating relationship between magic, medicine, and religion.",

        "Course Description": "Being a citizen of a modern democracy increasingly requires making decisions informed by our understanding of scientific consensus and the backing evidence. The stakes of these decisions range from the future of a warming planet to the benefits of vaccinations and GMOs to the persistence of racial bias and gender inequality.  Even our daily diets are pushed and pulled by competing nutritional studies and their distortions in the media.  Negotiating the volume of news and \"fake news,\" the available academic research, and the influence of special interests can be daunting - particularly when we try to reflect on our own blind spots and knowledge gaps.  Citizen Scientist uses these and other topics at the intersection of civic responsibility and academic research to introduce students to college writing. The course will teach students to analyze, research and generate scholarly arguments as they deepen their understanding of the dynamic interaction between public opinion, government policy, political activism, science journalism, citizen science, and the research university.

We study key concepts such as double consciousness, intersectionality, and performativity. We consider how social dynamics, power, and privilege affect the language we use and the lives we live. All along, through writing and research assignments and class discussions, we examine and interpret visual, literary, and critical texts in an effort to define, together, what identity is and why it matters.

        "Course Description": "Place & Perspective is a writing course featuring readings on the subject of our environments, whether social communities, physical spaces, or even virtual realities. As a class and as individuals, students will be asked to respond to these sources with writing of their own, practicing the academic traditions of interpreting, analyzing, criticizing, and researching. Most importantly, students will have the opportunity to write original works synthesizing and offering new views on what it means to live here in this world, to have a place in an ecosystem or a city, a house or a hospital. We'll study our local community, from perspectives in our classroom to the wider conversations across the St. Louis region as we discover and write about our surroundings. We'll foreground diversity in both in our class conversations and the writers we'll read, from issues of inequality to concerns of access and the responsibilities of citizens. The class will feature multidisciplinary perspectives in conversations with our faculty as they reflect on their experiences writing within and about places. We will consider how place-based thinking thrives across academic fields, from design thinking in art to systems science in engineering, from environmental policy in business to ethnographic writing in anthropology, to name a few possibilities.

        "Course Description": "What does your steak order have to do with your politics? How might our taste in film relate to our taste in sneakers? How does writing itself contribute to larger media discourse? This course will explore how our choices as consumers, creators, and writers are mediated by broader cultural forces such as film, foodways, music, television, art, and social media. \"Commodity culture\" refers to what aspects of culture can be evaluated in terms of supposed \"worth\" or economic value. Here students will think critically, draft, take risks, and revise to present work that has been elevated to college level writing and argumentation. Readings will explore a range of cultural texts and topics--whether it's the popularity of Grey Poupon in hip hop or racial tension in the St. Louis restaurant scene, the role of smartphones and social media in the rise of self-branding, or the blurred line between high art and instagram. As avid readers and writers, we will delve into the details of rhetorical context to approach both published media and our own essays as instances of cultural production. No prior knowledge of foodways, art history, or media studies is necessary for this course, but arrive hungry with an appetite for a nuanced appreciation of how something as seemingly innocuous as cultural output intersects with larger structures of status and power.

        "Course Description": "Writing is a technology that allows one to read the thoughts of others across space and time. Our course's theme, Technology, is the subject-matter we will be reading to hone skills such as analysis, argumentation, and critical thinking. This does not mean that you must be a budding technologist to succeed in this course, nor will this course seek to transform you into one. Rather, this course treats \"technology\" in its broadest sense; from its root in the Greek techne which means \"craftsmanship,\" \"craft,\" \"art,\" or \"rhetoric,\" to its contemporary definition as the realm of knowledge that deals with the mechanical arts and applied sciences. In writing about technology we will consider perspectives across the university curriculum in order to better comprehend our relationship with our tools and to scrutinize the dynamic interaction, communication, and interdependence of different kinds of tools for various means of communication and representation. We will strive to think critically about ourselves as part of larger communities and systems by attending closely to the ways we communicate with and about others through technologies such as writing, film, and social media. In writing creative, analytical, argumentative, and researched essays we will address responsible uses of technology, the effects that technologies have on different communities and individuals, and try to answer questions like: How does technology affect us when we use it? How do technologies intersect and affect one another? What roles does technology play in our everyday lives? And what roles do we want it to play in our future?

How will new technologies change how we live as individuals and as a society? How will our experiences and those who go before us shift how we imagine the possibilities open to our future selves? We will read essayists, critics, and theorists tackling these problems, and in turn, we will engage our new longer future through our own creative and critical responses as well.

Just what we mean by engaging - and by research, for that matter - will be our topic of conversation all semester, and you should come prepared to contribute your views on that topic and to complicate your current understanding.  Where possible, we will focus on practical, applied work with sources, which should provide a good foundation for advanced research and writing in your discipline, and we'll give some thought to the different methods by which different audiences and scholarly disciplines select, analyze, evaluate, incorporate, and document the works of others.  Along the way, we will attend to the relationship between different kinds of research projects and the types of sources that suit them, and we'll practice techniques for drawing on the ideas and writings of others in responsible and engaged ways.  Finally, we will grapple with the subtleties and complexities of Academic Integrity, attempting to understand not only the principles that govern responsible research but also the assumptions that underlie them.  Ultimately, this course should enhance your ability to produce scholarly writing that not only draws on the voices and views of others responsibly, but that also speaks with its own distinct, engaging voice, that builds its own original arguments.

We will engage these questions by way of an eclectic set of encounters between literary and analytical texts. Moore, his work, and his multiple literary and magical identities will be our starting point. Donna Tartt's novel \"The Secret History\" will accompany us across the semester as a ground for our theorizing. We will read our fictional texts from the theoretical viewpoints of psychoanalysis, anthropology, sociology, and the history of science.

We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures? Students unfamiliar with these sacred canons will gain a familiarity with their contents and cultural contexts, while those who already know one or more of them will inevitably discover new insights into their inter-relationship and subtle, often startling contents.",

In addition to literary works, the course will engage with two or three important models of critical practice e.g. Wollstonecraft's \"Vindication of the Rights of Woman,\" Marx's \"German Ideology,\" Freud's \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" T.S.

        "Course Description": "This course will approach the history, culture and literature of Nazism, World War II and the Holocaust by focusing on one particular aspect of the period-the experience of children. Children as a whole were drastically affected by the policies of the Nazi regime and the war it conducted in Europe, yet different groups of children experienced the period in radically different ways, depending on who they were and where they lived. By reading key texts written for and about children, we will first take a look at how the Nazis made children-both those they considered \"Aryan\" and those they designated \"enemies\" of the German people, such as Jewish children - an important focus of their politics. We will then examine literary texts and films that depict different aspects of the experience of European children during this period: daily life in the Nazi state, the trials of war and bombardment in Germany and the experience of expulsion from the East and defeat, the increasingly restrictive sphere in which Jewish children were allowed to live, the particular difficulties children faced in the Holocaust, and the experience of children in the immediate postwar period. Readings include texts by Ruth Klüger, Harry Mulisch, Imre Kertész, Miriam Katin, David Grossman and others. Course conducted entirely in English. OPEN TO FIRST YEARS. STUDENTS MUST ENROLL IN BOTH MAIN SECTION AND A DISCUSSION SECTION. Note: course will not count towards German major or minor.",

This course will introduce some of the foundational responses to this dominance, both literary and theoretical, by the colonized and their descendants. We will examine literary works that engage with postcolonial critique by authors such as V.S. Naipaul, Raja Rao, George Lamming, Doris Lessing, and N'gugi wa Thiong'o, as well as important critiques of colonialism by a variety of influential thinkers. Overall, the course will investigate how literature might have helped consolidate Empire, as well as ways in which it saw itself as a key mode of rebellion against imperial power, and we will end by considering how the urgent issues of postcolonial literature - race, gender, language, nationalism, identity - continue to haunt today's global literature.

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

        "Course Description": "Course taught in English for students interested in literature and the arts; first-year students welcome. This course examines the idea of connectivity in the arts. Via novels, paintings, photography, and film, we will explore questions of interpretation related to the themes of love and betrayal; bequests and legacy; and innocence and responsibility. Mirrored paintings by Velázquez and Picasso will engage us, as will a series of works by Vermeer and other Dutch masters depicting elegant women (and their dogs) in the company of their suitors will engage us in elaborate courtship rituals played out using letters, music, and wine. We will consider how, during the reigns of Francis I and Louis XIV, the French monarchy integrated Dutch art into its collections in order to assert the king's influence and authority. Students will discuss portraits that emerge from complex tableaux in Laclos's masterful novel of seduction, DANGEROUS LIAISONS; in 19th-century paintings; and in contemporary photographs. The class will read Doerr's ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE and de Waal's HARE WITH THE AMBER EYES, stories that link history with art, the past with the present, and gifts with thefts and bereavements. We will study excerpts from Daoud's MEURSAULT INVESTIGATION in relation to the work that inspired it: Camus's STRANGER [L'ETRANGER]. Adaptation will likewise inform our readings of Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Barnes's SENSE OF AN ENDING, and the pair of films based on these novels. The class will assess aspects of the original story that are lost on screen as well as the added resonances that the novels acquire in the film versions. Same as CL 385.",

The students will come out of the course having acquired: 1) a knowledge of fundamental concepts in feminist and gender studies; 2) an understanding of how feminist/gender studies scholars identify and frame research questions; 3) an introduction to the critical debates related to gender and sexuality; 4) a knowledge of feminist cultural history; 5) the ability to apply relevant concepts in feminist and gender studies to your own research in a historically-grounded fashion.",

Topics include dialogues between the German and Jewish Enlightenments, Salon culture and the development of meaningful contacts between Germans and Jews, the intersections of aesthetic discourse and antisemitism, the rise of Yiddish theater and the visual and acoustic language of the Jewish Renaissance. Moving beyond narratives of assimilation or acculturation, we will discuss the complex and shifting nature of German-Jewish subjectivities and investigate the entanglements of German, Austrian and Jewish culture through frameworks of difference, indifference, performance, and cultural transfer.

Readings draw on scholarship from ethnomusicology, anthropology and geography of the senses, sound studies, dance studies, performance studies, and music cognition. If ethnomusicology is \"the study of people making music,\" this course explores how people make and experience music and sound with their bodies, through the full range of their senses. We will ask questions such as: How do musicians, audiences, listeners and dancers perceive and experience music in their bodies and contribute to making sound? Centering the body, we will necessarily consider lived experience along intersecting axes of difference such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and (dis)ability. Course readings and discussions will therefore focus on the social and political affordances and limitations of body-based practices and their theorization. \n\nCase studies include a broad range of sound-movement practices from electronic dance music and black social dance to Sufi and Buddhist religious practices, queer taiko drumming to Deaf music-making. Over the course of the semester, students will develop their own project exploring course themes, and they will be asked to participate in music-movement workshops throughout the course. This is an upper-level/graduate-level course, so some knowledge of music and/or dance concepts is assumed, but neither previous music/dance experience nor normative bodily ability are required. \n",

We will also investigate how the lens of dance and choreography offers an expansive means to conceptualize political questions of citizenship and social protest, broadening our understanding of embodied performance. Guided by several key philosophical texts, our class will focus on concepts necessary to examining the convergence of performance and politics (such as representation, ritual, spectacle, body, mimesis, propaganda, etc) while also paying special attention to the politics of funding and censorship that has governed the creation and presentation of dance in the United States.

It includes a practice component introducing the students to movement disciplines such as Tai' Chi and opera, and allows students to pursue creative assignments such as interview, stage plays, and filmmaking that demonstrate their developing knowledge of historical and contemporary Chinese culture.

Rather than seeking definitive definitions or answers, we carefully and thoughtfully examine case studies of American culture and the arts-literature, theatre, film and painting-as the lens for understanding images of nation and identity. Utilizing an intimate seminar format to facilitate close reading and discussion of works in various media, this Ampersand course emphasizes both critical thinking and writing-and also requires students to execute a creative project of their own making as well. We also visit a variety of exciting performances and exhibits, both on and off-campus. Our primary goal is a compelling, interdisciplinary perspective on the American Dream, one that synthesizes the arts, performance and politics.

The course does not intend to train the student as a dancer or actor, but it maintains that the successful speaker would do well to harness some of the transferable skill sets from these disciplines.  The speaker, like the performer, must stand before an audience with an objective to communicate something well.  Both should be dedicated advocates for the message.  They share the common ground of requiring a strong voice for a sure delivery of the material, and an expressive physicality willing to fully embody and serve the message.",

        "Course Description": "The U.S. is in the midst of a second comedy boom. The first boom, during the 1980s, turned stand-up comedy into a major force in American entertainment, creating stars like Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, and Ellen DeGeneres. The second, defined in part by new social media, podcasting, and on-line video, is remaking the way comedians find their voices and their audiences. But even as young comedians chart new paths through a dynamic media landscape, live performance is still the heart of the modern comedy universe. This class is a detailed survey of the contemporary American comedy scene. Pioneering artists from Vaudeville through the 1970s are introduced, the stand-up boom of the 1980s is presented as a formative force in the comedy business, alt-comedy is discussed as a stylistic watershed. Select modern theories of comedy are read and discussed (though we studiously avoid explaining jokes). Short units on Improv and Sketch comedy round out the syllabus. Assignments include practical exercises in performing comedy onstage, and students can choose to perform a short original stand-up set for their final assignment.",

Students will analyze the various methodologies and types of \"fieldwork\" that scholars from across disciplines use to discuss the voice in music, including archival, ethnographic, and cultural studies approaches to research. We will investigate the voice's role in diverse forms of individual and group singing, how voice relates to technology and media, and how the diva archetype becomes applied to singers and vocal genres. A wide range of academic literature, media texts, and listening examples will be used to develop interdisciplinary and intersectional analyses of voice. Musical training is not required, but students will engage with musical sounds and content in class discussions and assignments and learn about how voices produce sound in different vocal traditions.",

Beginning with Romanticism's self-conscious break with the past, we'll study the rise of bourgeois melodrama with its intensely emotional rendering of character and spectacular effects.  We'll consider how those effects were made possible by advances in industrial stage technology which reproduced the everyday world with unprecedented verisimilitude, and how playwrights responded to those technologies by calling for the theatre to become either a \"total work of art\"--plunging its spectators into a mythical realm--or a petri dish--analyzing the struggles of the modern individual within his or her modern milieu.  Exploring a range of aesthetic modes--including Realism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Expressionism, the Epic Theatre, and the Theatre of the Absurd--we will read classic plays by modern playwrights to consider how the modern theatre helped its audiences understand as well as adapt to the rapidly changing conditions of the modern world.",

        "Course Description": "\"We the people\" is one of the most familiar refrains in American cultural and political life. But who is the \"we\" and who are the \"people?\" The founding documents of the U.S. issue forth a dispiriting paradox: \"the people\" are both the source of the democratic impulse as well as a narrowly construed category, one that excluded great swaths of the populace, including women, enslaved people, and indigenous people. \n \nThis course will use the theories and methods of performance studies to explore questions of American populism in media, politics, and art. Is populism a political orientation? Or is it a style that one enacts? What does it mean to claim that one acts on behalf of \"the people?\" Is all political behavior \"political theatre?\" \n \nWhile the November 2020 U.S. presidential election will undoubtedly play a major role in our inquiry, we will think cross-culturally and historically about performances of populism by both leaders and the people whom they claim to represent. Topics to be explored might include: the singing of anthems, the fandom of team sports, and the many ongoing attempts to fulfill the promise of \"we the people\" by those engaged in the black freedom struggle, movements for gender equality, and indigenous rights movements.\n\n\n A Writing Intensive course, AMCS 375A serves as an occasion for students to think about matters of argument and presentation, as well as the methods and models that will serve future research.

We will also investigate how the lens of dance and choreography offers an expansive means to conceptualize political questions of citizenship and social protest, broadening our understanding of embodied performance. Guided by several key philosophical texts, our class will focus on concepts necessary to examining the convergence of performance and politics (such as representation, ritual, spectacle, body, mimesis, propaganda, etc) while also paying special attention to the politics of funding and censorship that has governed the creation and presentation of dance in the United States.

Where does this energy come from? How long will it last? What are the consequences? Examination of energy resources and consumption from scientific, social, economic, and political viewpoints. Relationship of energy to concepts such as heat, work, and power. Energy use by society. Energy sources, pros and cons of use, availability now and in the future. Types, abundance, advantages, challenges of renewable energy sources.\nOne-third of the course will be online and asynchronous, with 30-minute professionally produced videos integrated into Canvas with built-in short quizzes. Another third of the course will also be online but be synchronous, through Zoom. This will be primarily active-learning exercises (debates, group projects, problem-based learning) through Zoom breakout rooms and advanced polling methods. These will be recorded and available within Canvas. The last third of the course I will try to do in-person, in the classroom. This will involve things such as group discussions on current issues and guest lectures followed by post-lecture group discussions. This will be done in a hyflex mode, with students online and in-person interacting together.",

        "Course Description": "The development of non-traditional isotope geochemistry in the past decade has greatly expanded our understanding of many facets of Earth and planetary sciences. Over 1000 papers have been published using non-traditional isotopes to study the origin of the solar system, the formation of planetary bodies, the differentiation of mantle and core, the evolution of the crust, the changes of paleo-climate, the global geochemical cycle of elements, and the genesis of natural resources. This course will survey these new isotope systems in either high-temperature igneous differentiation or low-temperature environments. It aims to help students understand the wide applications of these new isotopes in tracing chemical, biological and physical processes. The course is divided into three parts. Part I will first introduce the principles and theories of non-traditional isotopic fractionation and then it will review analytical methods that are primarily used for non-traditional isotopes such as MC-ICP-MS, TIMS and SIMS. Part II will dive into individual isotopic systems (Li, Mg, Si, Cl, Ca, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ge, Se, Mo, Hg, Tl and U stable isotopes) and it will focus on one or two of their main applications. Part III will be carried out in the instructor's lab for the last three weeks of the class. The instructor and the students will decide together on the one topic of the final project carried out all class members. The scope of the final project will depend on the students' own research interests and the instructor's role is to help the students to identify useful non-traditional isotope tools to advance the students' main research goals.\nPrereqs: EPS 441 (Introduction to Geochemistry) or EPS 446 (Stable Isotope Geochemistry), or permission of instructor.",

A collaboration between the East Asian Languages and Cultures and Performing Arts departments, this course explores Chinese cultural narratives in relation to how they have been performed--on stage in traditional forms of dance-drama, on screen in film, and as lived in the practice of everyday life--from the late Imperial period to the present. It includes a practice component introducing the students to movement disciplines such as Tai' Chi and opera, and allows students to pursue creative assignments such as interview, stage plays, and filmmaking that demonstrate their developing knowledge of historical and contemporary Chinese culture. Building bridges of understanding between the United States and the Republic of China in Taiwan, the course will culminate in a spring break trip to Taiwan.\n* This course is only for first-year, non-transfer students in the Ampersand: Encountering China program.\n",

        "Course Description": "The ritual act of taking refuge plays an important role throughout various Buddhist traditions. In this class, we will use this idea as a helpful framework to examine Buddhist doctrines, ideas, theories, and practices. We will attempt to understand what role various forms of media and their ritualistic appropriations played in Buddhist responses to the question of \"how can we end human suffering?\" To do so, we will observe four different ways in which practitioners took refuge in the Buddha. In the first section \"Taking Refuge in the Life of the Buddha,\" we will explore how practitioners attempted to emulate aspects of the Buddha's life stories (jataka). In the second section \"Taking Refuge in the Body of the Buddha,\" we will engage in the practice of relic veneration and its relationship to the Buddha's life stories. In the third section \"Taking Refuge in the Words of the Buddha,\" we will delve into the world of powerful scriptures and their ornamentation, production, and veneration. And in the last section \"Taking Refuge in the Realms of the Buddha,\" we will investigate Buddhist sacred geography and various forms of ma??alas. At the end, this course will offer you many different responses to the problem of human suffering that various Buddhist communities had developed. By surveying these distinct responses, we will realize that \"Buddhism\" is a conglomeration of quite rich and diverse practices and ideas, offering a plethora of sometimes concurring solutions to the problem of human suffering. At the same time, however, we will recognize recurrent themes and similar ritualistic appropriations of mixed media cultural objects that obviously transcended national, congregational, and disciplinary boundaries. In that sense, the heuristic framework of taking refuge in the Buddha allows us to see some continuity in the discontinuous development of Buddhist traditions, their material culture, and ritualistic performances.",

In particular, this course explores cultural encounters between China and other subregions of the Eurasian continent to the north and west of China, from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the present.  The course begins by analyzing the relationship between nomadic societies on the steppe (and, more generally, \"non-state spaces\") and settled, agricultural societies such as China.  We then turn to the influence of two religions imported from central Eurasia, Buddhism and Islam.  A related theme is the relationship, in the early modern era, between trade, which tended to erode boundaries, and states, which sought to create boundaries.  We will then trace the changing dynamics among commerce, religion, and nation-states in the twentieth century.  Finally, we return to the role of Buddhism and Islam in the contemporary relationship between the China and the various peoples and states across its western frontier.",

During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization.  From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation.  By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultural production.  In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation.  How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self?  And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?  Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature.  This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.  All literary texts are in English translation and no previous knowledge of Korean is required.",

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

        "Course Description": "Excessive emotion, unreasonable sacrifice, hidden truth, untimely knowledge, and forbidden desire-the power of melodrama and its moving representations have fueled the popularity of hundreds, if not thousands, of books, plays, and films. Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites. No prior knowledge of East Asian culture or language necessary. Required Screenings: Tuesdays @ 4pm\n",

How did STS in East Asia change from the early twentieth century onward? What are the main historiographical trends in writing East Asian sciences? And what kinds of questions are left unexplored? This course will in particular focus on the transformation from the early modern to the modern period (ca. 1600 to 2000), during which the organization of natural knowledge in East Asia witnessed a significant reconfiguration. Situating historical change at the intersection of local and global dynamics, this course will introduce a variety of subjects including histories\nof epistemology, technologies of governance, global circuits of knowledge transfer, the uneasy ties between colonialism and modern science, and issues around energy, infrastructure, and environment. Apart from familiarizing themselves with the history of science and technology, students will also obtain a firm grasp of historiographical and methodological problems that pertain to STS in East Asia from Joseph Needham's groundbreaking works to post-Needham critiques, to more recent debates around capitalism, science, and technology.",

We will sample a diverse array of economies, from gift exchange to the ceremonial destruction of wealth, from Melanesia to Wall Street, in order to evaluate some of the assumptions that undergird market capitalism.  These assumptions include the perception of market actors exclusively as calculative, maximizing individuals.  Topics to be covered include the Industrial Revolution; utilitarianism; economic anthropology; the formal vs. substantivist debates; ethnography of finance, and Marxist sociology.",

We will focus on popular experimental anomalies, including the Allais and Rabin paradoxes, ultimatum bargaining, the centipede and public goods contribution games. We will examine the extent to which these are consistent with standard economic theory and how they may contradict it. The primary focus will be a critical examination of psychological theories of non-standard preferences including loss aversion, probability weighting, reciprocity, fairness and present bias. Theories of incorrect beliefs and systematic biases such as money illusion and procrastination will be covered. Applications to the current economic crisis will also be discussed.\n\nThe class will include an introduction to experimental methods in economics, including hands-on experience in the MISSEL laboratory.\n\nA sound grounding in economic theory is essential to the course. You must have successfully completed Economics 4011, and should be acquainted with basic optimization theory, expected utility theory, risk aversion, discounting and basic game theory including dominance, Nash equilibrium and subgame perfection..",

This course is your initial study of econometric theory and practice. Topics include: translation of economic theory into statistical models, statistical foundations of econometrics, preregression analysis bivariate and multiple regression techniques, hypothesis testing, multicollinearity, specification error, autocorrelation, errors in variables, identification, and simultaneous estimation. The 3 writing assignments and the final paper will provide you an opportunity to formulate an economic model, estimate the model with appropriate data, and interpret the results. This experience will help you understand how econometrics relates to other upper-level economics courses which focus on theoretical models for how the world operates. Econometrics provides a method of testing the validity of these economic models, and the term paper will improve your writing skills, giving you a chance to write clearly and concisely about technical material.

These questions are important as we try to determine whether the current market society is sustainable or whether (and where and when) we should expect a \"Great Transformation\" to emerge. The course will address these questions via readings from the best lessons of psychology, economics, anthropology and history, with a particular focus on data and empirical results. Classes will consist of a combination of lectures and class discussions, supplemented by individual- and group-based writing assignments.

        "Course Description": "The \"economics of education\" involves analysis of the economic and social determinants and consequences of education. Because each person´s education is an investment in human capital which allows the individual to contribute to society in a productive way, education becomes a crucial determinant of an economy´s ability to achieve high growth with high wages, low unemployment and strong social cohesion. This course will address three essential topics from the wide-ranging field of the economics of education. The first is demand-side oriented and includes: (i) the measurement of the returns to education in the labor market (human capital theory; the central idea of education as human capital investment); and (ii) a characterization of the education production function, which relates the various inputs affecting a student´s learning (schools, families, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) to measure outputs including labor market success, graduation rates and standardized test scores. The second important topic involves political economy and the supply side: the financing and provision of education. The third part of the course is devoted to the links between education and economic development, including cross-country differences in schooling, returns to schooling and per-capita income.

We will discuss de- centralized matching markets (e.g., the marriage market), matching markets through institutions (e.g., medical labor market and school choice problem), and assignment problems (e.g., housing allocation). We study existing or new market institutions, understand their properties, and think about whether they can be reengineered or improved. This course assumes knowledge of the first-year economics PhD sequence, especially microeconomic theory.",

The first part of the course will cover basic results in continuous time stochastic process, and develop the essentials of stochastic calculus. In the second part, those tools will be used to analyze a variety of issues related to growth and asset pricing.  A partial sample of the questions that will be discussed includes:\n\n\"\tThe effects of policy and real instability on growth paths.\n\"\tThe impact of tax and fiscal policies on economic performance.\n\"\tThe equilibrium determination of asset prices and their relationship with real shocks.\n\"\tThe connection between aggregate quantities and the price of fixed income securities.\n",

Our goal in this course is to learn tools that help us to relate models to data, that is, we aim at learning how to answer quantitative questions and we will learn to do so by doing. This will require intensive computational work by students. We will learn how to construct and characterize equilibrium allocations of representative agent models, overlapping generations models and heterogeneous agents economies. We will learn the computational tools to solve those artificial economies in stationary and non-stationary environments such as business cycles or development processes taking good care of distributions and aggregate consistency. Much emphasis of this course is on the calibration process: we will spend much time discussing the mapping from theory to data. The grade will be some weighted average of regular homeworks, class presentations and a referee report.",

Video games, while often dismissed as frivolous entertainment, provide one such example of a significant experiential learning context: individual players develop skills in the pursuit of goals, collaborate with each other to advance their theorizing about the game's mechanics, and display deep engagement and persistence in the face of frustration despite a lack of extrinsic rewards. Among the questions encountered in this course will be: What kind of understanding is built through game play? How might games teach us about ourselves as learners? In what ways might the skills involved in learning to play a game transfer to learning in other contexts? What pedagogical lessons might teachers take from game designers? Throughout the course, readings and activities will promote rigorous, critical analysis of both games and theories of learning.",

        "Course Description": "One of the most exciting transformations in the social sciences in recent years is the finding that brief psychological exercises can improve important student outcomes for months and years, such as raising school achievement and reducing inequality. These interventions help individuals flourish and help our society live up to its ideals. They address critical psychological questions people have, like: Do people like me belong in this school?, Can I learn math?, When will I ever use what I am learning in class?. In this seminar, we will learn about psychological interventions in education; how they work; how they can cause lasting benefits; their intellectual lineage; how they can be used, adapted, and scaled to address contemporary problems; and challenges and mistakes that can arise in doing so. In addition to learning from classic and contemporary research, you will design your very own intervention and workshop others' efforts. When you have completed this seminar, you will more fully understand the psychological aspect of educational problems and how this can be addressed through rigorous research.",

We will develop a multifaceted view of literacy that is embedded within culture and acknowledges the influences of social institutions and conditions.

Many institutions have responded by increasing the number of mental health counselors available in student health centers, making the accommodations at disability resource centers more robust, and providing safe spaces for students to process incidents and events that have triggered them. Are such interventions improving the well-being of today's students or might they actually be further encumbering students' psychological health? This discussion-based course will explore arguments made on all sides of this provocative debate and examine research on the nature of today's college students and what resources and services most contribute to their psychological health and well-being.

The class will help prepare you for the diverse range of twenty-first century occupations that have language and linguistics at their center, including machine learning and translation studies. The class utilizes a survey format and covers both internal and external factors related to language acquisition and language use, such as language and the brain, language aptitude, age, gender, memory, prior knowledge, etc. Theoretical and research dimensions of both linguistics and foreign / second language learning are treated. Corresponding implications of the readings focus on action- on making decisions for language policies and debates around the world that are informed by linguistic and language knowledge. The course is required for the minor in applied linguistics, the PhD in Applied Linguistics, and the graduate certificate in language instruction. This course carries the Social and Behavioral Sciences attribute and can be taken for different majors such as International and Area Studies and Educational Studies.

        "Course Description": "In this course politics is interpreted broadly to not only include formal policy-making processes, but any situation in which people have to solve a problem or come to a decision. The purpose of this course is to explore the process of (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions influence pedagogies-especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge; (3) how pedagogies translate into specific school programs and practices; (4) how these programs and practices impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities influence ideologies and power dynamics. In doing so, this course considers a variety of key educational institutions and actors at the local, state, and federal levels. This course also considers politics across time, space, and individuals-noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. Additionally, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work towards the common good. Specifically, we explore stories that demonstrate how politics can influence the lived experiences of individuals from various class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identity groups. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e. \"What went wrong?\") to problem solution (\"Where do we go from here?\").",

This course, taught in English, connects to the mission of UNESCO and examines the wide range of theoretical and research issues, both historical and current, related to reading and writing across languages and cultures. Literacy acquisition among second language learners involves a number of variables including both cognitive and social factors. Topics to be discussed in class include universal cognitive operations, individual learner differences, text types and literary forms, literacy and social power, and the extent to which reading and writing are interrelated. Students will discuss how to bridge scientific research in the laboratory to practice and will be involved in St. Louis community outreach projects with refugees and immigrants at the International Institute, where they will create and implement reading and writing activities driven by theory and empirical investigations. Students will take the theory and research they learn and will help meet the local reading and writing needs of a changing population with a variety of backgrounds, values and educational preparations. The course is required for the minor in applied linguistics, the PhD in Applied Linguistics, and the graduate certificate in language instruction.

Emphasis will be placed on the development of studio based visual art techniques across the K-12 curriculum and how these can be used to foster creativity, imagination, critical thinking skills, and individual solutions to a variety of visual and integration based problems. \n\nThe philosophical bases for this course are the developing ideas that the arts are uniquely positioned to play an important role in helping all educators transform their teaching to address the needs of 21st century, K-12 learners. This progressive approach to arts education is based upon the framework that there are two separate but related roles for the arts in our schools. The first role for arts education is a standards based, sequential, comprehensive exploration of the arts founded on performance, criticism, process, communication and connections. The first role often takes a cross curricular approach to arts learning, but stays mainly focused on the arts. The second role is for the arts to be placed at the center of a variety of arts integration approaches to teaching and curriculum design. These approaches include arts integration, project based learning, universal design for learning, and STEAM.",

Just as college enrollments have dramatically increased, so too have the proportion of students suffering from mental illness.  Some have deemed that we are in the midst of a \"College Student Mental Health Crisis.\" From all directions, data are emerging, depicting a sobering scene.  How can the field of higher education best respond to this crisis?  Many institutions have increased the number of mental health counselors available in the student health center and made the accommodations at disability resource centers more robust.  Still, the same survey from the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that only half of students with a mental health diagnosis disclose their condition to their college.  This course will delve into the extant literature on the nature of mental health problems facing students today, and how professionals in the field can best respond to address such problems as they arise and to the extent possible, prevent them in the first place.

How have these novels re-imagined our history and helped shape notions of American identity? These are some of the central questions that we will pursue in this seminar as we read a series of novels that address some of the central political and cultural crises that the United States has faced in the wake of the Second World War. Possible texts include Philip Roth's THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, Rachel Kushner's THE FLAME THROWERS, James Baldwin's THE FIRE NEXT TIME, Joan Didion's DEMOCRACY, Jonathan Lethem's DISSIDENT GARDENS, and Viet Than Nguyen's THE SYMPATHIZER.",

        "Course Description": "From the sensationalized violence of \"Game of Thrones\" to Luke Skywalker's monastic planet in \"The Last Jedi,\" in advertisements for light beer (dilly dilly!) and in the fairytale castle that appears before every Disney movie - the contemporary imagination is infused with fictional representations of the European middle ages. In fantasy and science fiction writing in particular, postapocalyptic futures and magical parallel universes are indebted frequently to a mythologized version of the medieval past. We recognize the \"medieval\" intuitively by its shining knights, dour monks, clever witches, and grimy peasants. But what do these fictions have to do, if anything, with the way the medieval world thought about itself? And why do so many modern thinkers turn to an unfamiliar past in order to question the urgent political, social, religious, and ecological concerns of the present? What, in short, does the medieval have to do with the fantastic, the unnatural, or the strange? Readings may include medieval texts by Walter Map, Marie de France, William Langland, and Geoffrey Chaucer alongside modern texts by Walter M. Miller Jr., Terry Pratchett, Angela Carter, and N.K. Jemisin.",

Works will range from those by Edgar Allan Poe in the 1840s to Arthur Conan Doyle´s Sherlock Holmes stories from the late nineteenth century.

The broader historical context for our readings include the urbanization and mechanization of society, technological transformations that seemed to both empower and confine, shifts in social norms regarding sexuality and gender, and a grave concern about the ability of alien, exotic or bestial agents to penetrate domestic space-what is often called 'the homeland' in the mass media of our day.

We will study the development of familiar stages in narratives of substance abuse-i.e. experimentation, transcendence, downward spiral, \"rock bottom,\" and recovery/sobriety-posing questions like: What symbolic and literal positions have addicts occupied in their societies? How has the modern pharmaceutical industry and the War on Drugs impacted perceptions of \"typical\" drug use? How do race, gender, age, class, and sexuality factor into the imagination and realities of chemical dependency? To what non-narcotic substances-e.g. media, gambling, sex, adrenaline-do we consider people addicted? We will read diverse selections of poetry, fiction, scholarship, and memoir from authors like Samuel Coleridge, William Burroughs, James Baldwin, Sherman Alexie, Denis Johnson, Irvine Welsh, Paul B. Preciado, Melissa Broder, Tao Lin, Michelle Alexander, Laurie Weeks, Mian Mian, Reginald Dwayne Betts, and Nico Walker. Through discussions and short writing assignments, we will explore various imaginations of addicts as tortured souls, creative geniuses, immature party-goers, and/or depraved monsters, seeking to better understand the way experiences of addiction shape perception, and in turn, how perceptions of addiction shape human experience.",

        "Course Description": "Groucho Marx, the famous slapstick comedian and distinguished analytical philosopher, once observed that \"practically everybody in New York has half a mind to write a book--and does.\"  Marx may have been exaggerating (slightly) for comic effect, but it's a fact that New York City flourished as the literary capital of the U.S. during the 20th century.  Despite the heyday of the MFA \"Program Era,\" the city qualifies as the national headquarters of American writing even today.  This sophomore seminar will explore a surprisingly understudied feature of New York's centrality to modern American literary life: the appearance of wave after wave of captivating books picturing Manhattan, Brooklyn, and their fellow boroughs as the focal point and limit case of American identity. We'll begin with three famous texts from 1925 that cast Jazz Age New York as an alluring and treacherous pilgrimage site: F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby,\" John Dos Passos's \"Manhattan Transfer,\" and Alain Locke's Harlem Renaissance-defining \"New Negro\" anthology.  We'll then turn to less familiar New York-set texts of the Depression 1930s (Pietro Di Donato's \"Christ in Concrete\" and Betty Smith's \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\"); from the uneasy post-World War II pinnacle of American power (E.B. White's \"Here Is New York\" and Langston Hughes's \"Montage of a Dream Deferred\"); from the lost world of interracial Greenwich Village bohemia (Frank O'Hara's \"Lunch Poems\" and James Baldwin's \"Sonny's Blues\"); and, finally, from our own 21st century, nostalgic for the gritty and inflamed New York City of the 1970s (Patti Smith's punky art memoir \"Just Kids\" and Jennifer Egan's arty punk novel \"A Visit from the Goon Squad\").  Along the way, we'll pay special attention to the relationship between New York writing and the city's lively arts, visiting St. Louis's Jazz Bistro to hear the living heritage of Bebop, invented in Harlem in the early 1940s.  By the end of the semester, all comers should have a firmer and more creative sense of New York's hold on American writers and readers. This seminar, for sophomores only, may be counted toward the English major. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and Later requirement.",

        "Course Description": "What is the Great American Novel? This is a question that has been hotly debated for decades, from Harriet Beecher Stowe to Ralph Ellison, William Faulkner to Toni Morrison. It's a question with a hundred answers and no answers at all-a question of taste, of prejudice, of time. But what is a \"Great American Novel\"? What does it look like? What do we expect of it? What have Americans throughout history wanted it to say about America? These are questions we can, and will, answer in this course. As elusive a thing as the Great American Novel has been, the idea of the Great American Novel has a long and fascinating history that mirrors all the major movements of American literature from the American Renaissance to the present. Piecing together the story of this dream, this cultural quest with all of its inclusions and exclusions, is a way of telling a shadow history of American society. The Great American Novel tradition is something like a fossil record of America's shifting norms in relation to race, gender, sexuality, domesticity, democracy, citizenship, immigration, labor, capitalism, and war. And so each presumptive Great American Novel is a new variation in an evolving genre and a new thesis statement of American grandiosity or guilt. By cataloguing shared themes, conventions, and preoccupations, and by paying close attention to a handful of likely-and unlikely-candidates, this course will ask big questions about American exceptionalism, American tragedy, and the role of art in American culture. Authors will likely include Harriet Beecher Stowe, Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

In addition to literary works, the course will engage with two or three important models of critical practice e.g. Wollstonecraft's \"Vindication of the Rights of Woman,\" Marx's \"German Ideology,\" Freud's \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" T.S.

Because of its relation to modern English, however, enough of the language can be learned within weeks to begin reading Old English texts. In this course students will master the elements of Old English language, and learn enough to read and enjoy some of the greatest poetry in Old English, including Beowulf, and the culture that produced it. We shall compare the originals with modern translations by great poets such as Heaney and Pound. We shall also look forward to changes in the English language after the Norman conquest.

From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's \"The Human Stain,\" Jonathan Franzen's \"The Corrections\") and popular films (Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" and The Cohen brothers' \"The Big Lebowski\") to personal memoir and the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history. Other possible texts include David Foster Wallace's \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" Joan Didion's \"Political Fictions,\" Toni Morrison's \"Paradise,\" John Updike's \"Rabbit at Rest,\" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's \"Prozac Nation.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

In this course we will explore in depth the last one hundred years' American tradition of horror stories, ghost stories, weird tales, strange tales, slipstream, dark fantasy, and cosmic horror, with an emphasis on how these genres are critiqued ethically and morally by women and writers of color. We will be haunted by critical writings on concepts like the uncanny, the strange, the eerie, the macabre, cosmicism, and dread. From H.P. Lovecraft to Stephen King and Victor LaValle, \"The Twilight Zone\" to Jordan Peele's \"Us,\" Shirley Jackson to Carmen Maria Machado, and Angela Carter to Kelly Link, American horror stories peel back the coffin-lid on some of the most astounding truths about the psyche, the nation, and the cosmos.

After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series´ departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy.

And what does it mean for U.S. politics to tell these stories from a variety of global perspectives? This course explores the wealth of immigration narratives produced in the twenty-first century in order to investigate what characterizes U.S. immigration for this generation. Through an archive of contemporary novels, poetry, film, visual art, and music, we will examine the different strategies immigrants to the United States use to tell their stories and how those stories are impacted by national origin, race, gender, and class. From Lulu Wang's multigenerational tragi-comedy The Farewell to Valeria Luiselli's borderland essay Tell Me How It Ends, we will search for connection and contrast among different kinds of immigrant journeys, experiences, and art forms. This course is open to students at all levels who are willing to think deeply and creatively about the materials we study. Artists examined will include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jhumpa Lahiri, Shaun Tan, and Jose Antonio Vargas. \n\nAmerican Culture Studies (AMCS) is a multidisciplinary program that provides both a broader context for study in different fields and a deeper understanding of American culture in all of its complexities.",

This course will introduce some of the foundational responses to this dominance, both literary and theoretical, by the colonized and their descendants. We will examine literary works that engage with postcolonial critique by authors such as V.S. Naipaul, Raja Rao, George Lamming, Doris Lessing, and N'gugi wa Thiong'o, as well as important critiques of colonialism by a variety of influential thinkers. Overall, the course will investigate how literature might have helped consolidate Empire, as well as ways in which it saw itself as a key mode of rebellion against imperial power, and we will end by considering how the urgent issues of postcolonial literature - race, gender, language, nationalism, identity - continue to haunt today's global literature.

Yet Cleopatra was also a formidable military strategist, a powerful leader who studied medicine and spoke nearly a dozen languages. Most importantly, Cleopatra was the prototype for depicting strong women on the throne. This course will explore how Early Modern writers re-imagined Cleopatra in the Renaissance, a time which saw another strong queen, Elizabeth I, rise to power. We will pay special attention to how writers used Cleopatra to engage with Early Modern issues of globalization, gender, history, and politics. Finally, we will think about how Shakespeare and his contemporaries contrasted the exotic and sometimes scandalous Cleopatra with the virginal Queen Elizabeth. Readings may include works by Cicero, Lucan, Plutarch, and Virgil from antiquity; and plays by Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Daniel, Brandon, Elizabeth Cary, Fletcher, Dryden, and Shakespeare as well as the writings of Queen Elizabeth from the Renaissance.  3 short responses; midterm and final papers; and a presentation introducing one of the assigned readings.

        "Course Description": "It is usually assumed that poetry, as a genre, presents the most intensely charged form of literary language. Extending this premise, the Art of Poetry offers an introduction to advanced literary study through a directed series of close readings. To give students a critical vocabulary for analysis, an instinct for discovering and evaluating literary problems, and a sense of different historical periods of poetic production, we study the formal and conventional aspects of verse, taking the major elements of poetic craft-the line, the stanza, rhythm and meter, metaphor and simile, symbolism, etc.-as our main categories of analysis. In doing so, we establish a basis of intellectual understanding for the special, often powerful effect that poems can produce in us. Whether or not the student becomes an English Major, however, the course is designed to provide the reader (or writer) of poetry with an experience and a set of skills that will inform and foster this enthusiasm. This 300-level course can count as an upper-level elective for the English major.",

We read one of the best selling novels of the century, one that created a scandal and ruined the author's literary reputation, along with others that have garnered more attention in our time than their own.  In addition to focusing on these women writers, we also explore questions about the canon and American literature:  What makes literature \"good\"?  What constitutes American literature?  How does an author get in the canon and stay there?  Finally, in this writing intensive course, there are frequent writing assignments and a strong emphasis on the essential writing process of drafting and revising.",

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

Beginning with Wharton's reimagining of national and gender identity in \"The House of Mirth\" (1905) and \"The Age of Innocence\" (1920), we will read Stein's \"Three Lives (1909); Cather's \"My Ántonia\" (1913) and \"Sapphira and the Slave Girl\" (1940); Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937); and selected poems by Marianne Moore such as her satire \"Marriage\" (1923). Modernist literary women tried to imagine freer social roles for themselves, their characters or personae, and their readers. But to what extent was biographical and social experience aesthetic fate, and how does nostalgia function in this period? There will be a midterm paper, a final paper, and a formal oral report. Faithful attendance and class participation are required, naturally! Graduate students will have extra responsibilities, to be discussed at our first class meeting.

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more. In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports. Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century. Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising. This portion of the course will include a viewing of the iconic 1931 Boris Karloff film, which established indelible versions of the mad scientist and his \"monster.\" Students in this seminar will be supported in developing individual final projects of their own design.

We will also think about the Middle Ages as a period understood to have given birth to two especially influential modes and articulations of feeling: \"courtly love\" and \"affective piety.\" Our readings will include everything from autobiography to rhetorical treatise, lyric to penitential manual, romance to hagiography. Written assignments will focus on writing for broader public as well as academic audiences; students will work on finding public venues for their writing, writing pitches, and writing short pieces for broad audiences as well as writing more traditional article-length papers.

        "Course Description": "In today's complex business environment, organizations are constantly challenged to develop and execute innovative policies and processes that ensure profitable growth. Some leaders believe that the sole purpose of business is to maximize shareholder wealth and that profitability (or fiscal sustainability) is not compatible with environmental responsibility. In reality, ecological and economic performance need not-and should not-be mutually exclusive. Fortunately, the outmoded mindset of \"profit-at-any-cost\" is beginning to shift as organizations recognize the importance of adopting balanced business practices that promote economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental quality. Organizations that embed sustainability into their corporate strategies increase operational efficiency by using resources more responsibly and minimizing waste. In an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace, sustainability has become a source of competitive advantage through which an organization can have a positive impact not only on the \"bottom line\" but also on the environment and society. In this course, we explore key concepts, debates, and issues driving sustainability in business. We will also look at various sustainability tools, principles, and frameworks that business can use to better understand the natural systems from which sustainability is derived and upon which all organisms and organizations rely to sustain their own existence.",

How did the mandatory short-term goals of health and economic security sought so eagerly by citizens, and supported by evolving technologies, foreshadow the unintended consequences of long-term environmental damage that would contribute to climate change, and how can we understand this using a critical and hopeful lens?  Considering contemporary writings on our perception of \"environmentalism\" will help us nuance our analysis.  Topics will include but not be limited to; agrarian democracy, settlement of the Great Plains by immigrant farmers, fragmentation of the Sioux ecosystem and the Dust Bowl era.\n \nThis cultural research will frame visits to the Tyson Research Center, Washington University's research field station in west St. Louis County.  Tyson's mission is to provide a living landscape for environmental research and education as a component of Washington University's International Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainability (InCEES).   As a class we will meet with faculty researchers (from both science and the humanities) and hear about their work on ecosystem sustainability, that is, thinking long-term for human and environmental health.\n \nClass work on the Dust Bowl era will be informed by documentaries (Roosevelt administration's, The Plow that Broke the Plains and Ken Burns' Dust Bowl) and will be followed by training with WU GIS specialist Bill Winston, enabling each student to create a StoryMap about the Dust Bowl environmental disaster.   \n \nThis course is for first-year students and sophomore students only.\n",

One Health is a collaborative effort of multiple disciplines - working locally, nationally, and globally - to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. The student will learn about the challenges threatening environmental, animal, and human health. More importantly, they will learn about the transdisciplinary - holistic - One Health approach necessary if we are to develop the solutions to these challenges. From the loss of biodiversity, climate change and environmental pollutants, the students will participate in project-based learning modules to understand the how and why of these challenges as well as the mechanisms to study the current threats to conservation and public health. Class lessons will consist of lectures, clicker-based discussions, and case-study discussions. Assignments will include regular readings, quizzes, 3 exams, creating one infographic to convey a concept to a lay audience, and one short final reflection essay. There are no pre-requisites for this course. This course is recommended for first- and second-year students; third and fourth year students should contact the instructors for permission.",

We cover the foundational biological principles and contemporary issues within four main topics: human population growth, transfer of energy and carbon in the ecosystem, biodiversity, and food production. We focus on the biological principles involved as we examine these topics in the context of some contentious and confusing issues related to environmental biology in everyday life. The science literacy skills that you master in this course will help you address the issues you face in your everyday life regarding scientific and pseudoscientific claims about the environment and society and will form the foundation for your development as a critical consumer of science information in the media. This course is required for all environmental biology majors and environmental studies minors. We recommend you take this course in your first- or second-year if possible. If your interests align and your schedule allows, we recommend co-enrolling in ENST 215: Introduction to Environmental Humanities.\n\n\n\n",

        "Course Description": "Our planet is finite but our economic theories and practices assume that our economy can grow forever.   \n \nThe paradoxical pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet has real-world consequences:  from climate change to increasing income inequality to stagnant and declining quality of life for most of us to the ongoing mass extinction of species that are not economically useful to us, but whose loss simplifies ecosystems to the point of collapse.  If these trends continue we will face some very difficult times ecologically and socio-politically.\n \nOne alternative to infinite-planet economic theory is Ecological Economics, which can be described as economics as if the laws of thermodynamics are true and apply to us. Alone among disciplines with any aspiration to analytic rigor, the field of economics has remained unaffected by the thermodynamic revolution that transformed such fields as biology, chemistry, physics, even history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  This failure to take physical law into account is one great source of our society's environmental (and social, and political) problems.  Ecological economics thus represents the continuation of the thermodynamic revolution begun in the 1880s.\n \nThis course is designed to give you an appropriate grounding in the fundamental assumptions, the conceptual novelties, and the distinctive tools of analysis that comprise this emergent school of economic theory, while placing this theorizing in historical (and ecological) context.   We'll pay particular attention to how the precepts and practice of Ecological Economics illuminate the largest challenge facing humans today, the necessity of developing an ecologically sustainable society, one that is sized to the limits of our finite planet.    \n",

To ward off that fear, we assess the state of the world in the most dramatically pessimistic ways to indicate the seriousness of our situation and our personal commitment to \"environmentalism.\"  Highlighting (much less admiring) human progress in areas where solid evidence of its flourishing exists, seems blasphemous, dismissive of evident, copious human suffering and natural systems abuse.  However, the absence of acknowledging human progress reinforces social fear and a sense of danger.  The resulting panic leads to a preferencing of solutions which appear \"in harmony with nature,\"  limiting our understanding and trust of viable alternative solutions using our best social, economic and technological powers.  As antidote to this cycle, in this course we will explore the precepts of environmental modernism, the reconciliation of environmental preservation with human development.",

We first review the effects of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) on peace and conflict in the international system, and on the stability and well-being of regimes that are rich with such resources. We discuss the major role that energy plays in regional and interstate politics by examining the energy policy of various actors in the international system, including the United States, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, China, Russia, Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran. The course will also deal with various issues in global environmental politics, as well as global trends in the use of renewables and nuclear energy.

This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

The course will use the latest version of ESRI ArcGIS. The course is taught using a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on, interactive tutorials in the classroom. You will also explore the scientific literature to understand how GIS is being used by various disciplines to address spatial questions. The course takes a multidisciplinary approach that is focused on learning the tools of GIS versus working with data from a particular field. The goal is to establish a solid foundation you can use to address spatial questions that interest you, your mentor, or your employee. The first weeks of the course will provide a broad view of how you can display and query spatial data and produce map products. The remainder of the course will explore the power of GIS with a focus on applying spatial analytical tools to address questions and solve problems. As the semester develops, more tools will be added to your GIS toolbox so that you can complete a final independent project that integrates materials learned during the course with those spatial analyses that interest you the most. Students will have the choice of using a prepared final project, a provided data set, or designing an individualized final project using their own or other available data.",

Students will participate in projects with clients and partners on- or off-campus, developed with and guided by faculty advisors drawn from across the University, ultimately delivering an applicable end-product that explores \"wicked\" problems requiring innovative methods and solutions. Past projects have included investigating soil impacts of de-icing practices on campus, collecting data on inequitable trash collection in neighborhoods, working with St. Louis City's building division to make buildings more energy efficient, and developing an understanding of how buildings impact birds on campus. Fall 2020 projects may include previously mentioned projects, and may also include helping a municipality develop a sustainability plan, working on sustainable investing practices, mitigating plastic pollution in the Mississippi, and developing composting toilets. The team-based project will be complemented by a seminar that will explore problem solving strategies and methodologies drawn from a wide range of creative practices, including design, engineering, and science, as well as contemporary topics in energy, environment, and sustainability. Students will draw on these topics to influence their projects. The course is designed primarily for undergraduates, with preference given to seniors.",

        "Course Description": "RESET is an experience-focused class that will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the factors that are shaping the rapidly growing renewable energy industry, as well as the opportunities and challenges in the years ahead for decarbonizing the electric grid. In this interdisciplinary course focused on business, policy, and financial aspects of renewable energy, students will learn through classroom lectures from faculty, industry professionals, and policy-makers; group discussions; field trips to solar, wind, and fossil fuel power plants; and a final applied team-based project to propose new major solar photovoltaic arrays in the City of St. Louis.\n \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a Special Report in Fall 2018 that concluded that global emissions need to be reduced by roughly 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Decarbonizing the electric grid through renewables is one of the highest impact solutions for achieving such ambitious targets. How quickly can the US and the world accelerate the transition to renewable energy? What technical problems will need to be addressed? What is the current and future role of policy? What are the economic implications?\n \nOriginally developed as an independent study focused on solar energy deployment, RESET is now being offered as a 3-credit course with an expanded focus that includes wind, solar, energy storage, and the complex dynamics that govern the electrical grid. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the large-scale issues influencing renewable energy development, as well as the real-world factors that are necessary for designing, financing, and building new wind and solar projects.\n \nThis class is a direct-to-waitlist, application-based class.

        "Course Description": "This course constitutes the technical component of an interdisciplinary environmental law clinic based at the Law School. Engineering and Arts & Sciences students work in interdisciplinary teams with law students, handling environmental projects for public interest, environmental or community organizations or individuals. Students from other schools may also participate with permission of instructors. Projects may involve the following activities: representing clients in federal and state court litigation and administrative proceedings; drafting proposed legislation; commenting on proposed regulations, permits, environmental impact statements, and similar documents; giving testimony at public hearings and participating in workgroup or stakeholder meetings; analyzing and interpreting environmental data and reports; and evaluating matters for potential future action. The goal is that for each project, students will have primary responsibility for handling the matter, and faculty will play a secondary, supervisory role. Non-law students may provide such technical support as investigating unknown facts, evaluating facts presented by other parties (such as in government reports), and working with law students to develop and present facts relevant to an understanding of the matter and how to resolve it. Non-law students must work at least an average of 12 hours per week on clinic matters, including attendance at and participation each week in: at least one individual meeting with the professor; one group meeting involving the student team assigned to each project and the professors; and a two-hour seminar for all students in the clinic. Prerequisites: The clinic is open to graduate students and upper-level undergraduates. Coursework and/or experience in environmental engineering, environmental science, environmental policy, or related fields is recommended but not required. Admission: Students who register for the clinic are also required to submit a resume and a brief statement of interest to Clinic Scientist Ken Miller at kenneth.miller@wustl.edu. Enrollment is limited to 8 students. All students will be placed on the waitlist upon registering; students will then be selected to enroll from the waitlist. Enrollment decisions are typically made 1-2 weeks after the start of registration so students should register and submit the required forms as early as possible to receive full consideration.

As the semester develops, more tools will be added to your GIS toolbox so that you can complete a final independent project that integrates materials learned during the course with those spatial analyses that interest you the most. Students will have the choice of using a prepared final project, a provided data set, or designing an individualized final project using their own or other available data.",

Our study will encompass a number of critical frameworks, including myth, adaptation, gender, race, and transmedia storytelling. Each course unit will focus on how different media have presented one or more superhero franchises (e.g., Superman, Batman, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Watchmen).

A more specific examination of mechanics, the nuts and bolts of story construction, plotting, pacing, etc. will follow to support the ongoing writing process.  In-class exercises will aid the writer in sharpening skills and discovering new approaches to form and content.  Writers' work will be shared and discussed regularly in class.

But these abysmal statistics do not reflect the reality that female directors are producing some of the most innovative and exciting films of the 21st century. This course is intended to provide a general overview of the remarkable contributions of women directors to contemporary cinema (1990-present). First, we will turn our attention to women in the commercial industry, examining topics such as female authorship, popular genres, and the gender politics of production cultures in Hollywood. Then, we will survey women directors working outside of the system in documentary, independent, and experimental filmmaking modes. Finally, we will adopt a transnational perspective to investigate the contributions of women directors to world cinema, contextualizing the films of \"women cinéastes\" from countries such as Hong Kong, Argentina, and Iran in relation to their national cinemas and international film festival networks. In addition, we will discuss the films of women directors in terms of feminist and gender issues and as texts that clarify critical issues in film analysis, interpretation, and criticism.

        "Course Description": "Entertainment and communications forms combine and blend, and they have done so across millennia. However, the phenomenon of media convergence has taken on a special salience over the last one-and-a-half-centuries, as exemplified by the growing intermixture of film, radio, television, gaming, and the internet. In particular, critics, consumers, politicians, and producers used convergence as structuring principle in understanding, regulating, and planning for the future of media culture. This course engages with contemporary worries and enthusiasms about convergence by considering the specific conditions in which the phenomenon has been understood and practiced. Tracing a historical arc though the Twentieth Century, we will first examine convergences of radio and film, film and music publishing, television and film exhibition, and disparate corporate entities as basis for understanding more recent media combinations. Building on that foundation, the majority of the course will consist of case studies of media convergence since 1980, considering it in terms of industry, technology, regulation, and audiences. These case studies will also provide students with a survey of and inquiry into questions of historiographic theory and method. Note: This course satisfies the history & historiography requirement for the FMS Graduate Certificate. Required Screenings:  Thursdays @ 4pm\n",

        "Course Description": "Excessive emotion, unreasonable sacrifice, hidden truth, untimely knowledge, and forbidden desire-the power of melodrama and its moving representations have fueled the popularity of hundreds, if not thousands, of books, plays, and films. Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites. No prior knowledge of East Asian culture or language necessary. Required Screenings: Tuesdays @ 4pm\n",

Students will gain an understanding of genre both as a critical construct as well as a form created by practical economic concerns, a means of creating extratextual communication between film artist/producers and audience/consumers.  Genres for study will be chosen from the western, the gangster film, the horror movie, the musical, screwball comedy, science fiction, the family melodrama, the woman's film, and others.  In addition to film showings, there will be readings in genre theory as well as genre analyses of individual films.  Required screenings: Wednesdays @ 7pm",

Through readings and discussion, we will consider the great variety of ways literature expresses these values, and will explore them ourselves via creative assignments. Along the way, we will learn about literary culture today through discussions with nationally renowned writers and scholars who will visit the class, and you will write and workshop your own stories, poems, and non-fiction works.

        "Course Description": "One of the most exciting transformations in the social sciences in recent years is the finding that brief psychological exercises can improve important student outcomes for months and years, such as raising school achievement and reducing inequality. These interventions help individuals flourish and help our society live up to its ideals. They address critical psychological questions people have, like: Do people like me belong in this school?, Can I learn math?, When will I ever use what I am learning in class?. In this seminar, we will learn about psychological interventions in education; how they work; how they can cause lasting benefits; their intellectual lineage; how they can be used, adapted, and scaled to address contemporary problems; and challenges and mistakes that can arise in doing so. In addition to learning from classic and contemporary research, you will design your very own intervention and workshop others' efforts. When you have completed this seminar, you will more fully understand the psychological aspect of educational problems and how this can be addressed through rigorous research.",

        "Course Description": "Although we often associate education with school-based activity, human beings learn in multiple environments beyond the formal classroom. Video games, while often dismissed as frivolous entertainment, provide one such example of a significant experiential learning context: individual players develop skills in the pursuit of goals, collaborate with each other to advance their theorizing about the game's mechanics, and display deep engagement and persistence in the face of frustration despite a lack of extrinsic rewards. Among the questions encountered in this course will be: What kind of understanding is built through game play? How might games teach us about ourselves as learners? In what ways might the skills involved in learning to play a game transfer to learning in other contexts? What pedagogical lessons might teachers take from game designers? Throughout the course, readings and activities will promote rigorous, critical analysis of both games and theories of learning.",

Drawing on recent work in history, media studies, and political theory, we will also explore together scholarly debates about the function of spectacles in each society, from moral instruction or expressions of communal identity to social control or negotiations for power. By the end of the semester students will be equipped to compare the highly\nartificial and theatrical aesthetics characteristic of Julio-Claudian Rome with spectacular modes of expression in our own age of mass production and global telecommunications, including modern protest movements and blockbuster films such as Ben-Hur and Gladiator.",

This Ampersand course investigates how perceptions, representations, and meanings of the American Dream have changed throughout history-and how they live on in the contemporary United States. Rather than seeking definitive definitions or answers, we carefully and thoughtfully examine case studies of American culture and the arts-literature, theatre, film and painting-as the lens for understanding images of nation and identity. Utilizing an intimate seminar format to facilitate close reading and discussion of works in various media, this Ampersand course emphasizes both critical thinking and writing-and also requires students to execute a creative project of their own making as well. We also visit a variety of exciting performances and exhibits, both on and off-campus. Our primary goal is a compelling, interdisciplinary perspective on the American Dream, one that synthesizes the arts, performance and politics. This course is intended for first-year students; any seats remaining after first-year students enroll are open to other classes.\n\n",

The social, ethnic, and religious diversity, and the political and gender-related complexities of the Vietnamese are typically neglected. By focusing almost exclusively on Vietnam, US narratives of the war also tend to gloss over the wider regional dimensions of the conflict. In the interest of redressing this imbalance, this course examines the outlook, values, agency, and experiences of northern and southern Vietnamese, as well as rural and urban Cambodians and Laotians. Drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary sources it provides a macro and micro level historical analysis of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos from the premodern era until the present. In so doing, it explores the early sociocultural foundations of ancient Southeast Asian civilizations, the impact of Chinese and French colonialism, and Japanese occupation, the rise of Indochinese nationalist and communist revolutionary movements, the process of decolonization, the impact of U.S. military intervention, the rise and fall of the Khmer Rouge, postwar political and economic developments, and the memories and multiple meanings of the Vietnam Wars for Southeast Asians.

We will engage these questions by way of an eclectic set of encounters between literary and analytical texts.

        "Course Description": "\"Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide.  In spite of focused research efforts, cancer still poses a unique biomedical puzzle as it is now recognized that cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of many disorders with underlying mechanistic complexities that can affect most tissues in the human body.  This interactive 1st-semester course provides an introductory overview of the biology, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.  We touch upon background topics in DNA structure and replication, gene regulation and transcription, protein synthesis, mutations and DNA repair, but the primary focus is on the genetic and molecular changes that normal cells undergo during transformation into malignant cancer cells, emphasizing the dysfunction of essential biological processes like programmed cell death, cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune surveillance.  Classical diagnosis and treatment methods are compared with newer strategies, such as targeted therapies.  Finally, the growing role of \"\"omics\"\" technologies in tumor classification, patient prognosis, and therapy are discussed.  The course is a mix of lectures, student-led discussions/presentations, guest seminars and activities.  Lectures provide an overview of each topic, while activities and discussions of cutting-edge oncology topics in the news and primary literature familiarize students with current trends in cancer research/treatment as well as enhance reading and critical analysis skills.  Students choose a specific type of cancer for further study and near the end of the semester prepare a presentation to the class on its molecular and cellular etiology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and current/future treatment options.  Midterm Exams, which attendance is required, will be administered on Wednesday, September 23, 6:30 - 8 pm & Wednesday, October 28, 6:30 - 8 pm.\nPrerequisite: High school biology and chemistry, while completing AP or Honors biology is highly recommended.

        "Course Description": "A consideration of three primary areas of research in cognitive science: attention, memory, and language.  These topics are used to illustrate the techniques by which mental abilities are investigated and explained in psychology and neuroscience: the focus, in particular, is on the use of reaction time studies, brain imaging, and cell recordings to isolate the basic components that make up complex functions.  In addition to the central concepts and theories in each area, the course will address philosophical implications of this research concerning how the mind and brain are related, how the mind-brain encodes or represents information, and the nature of consciousness.  And there will be an emphasis on applying these findings to important problems, such as Alzheimer's disease and deficits due to brain damage.  The class is taught by three members of the faculty from different disciplines and combines a whole-group lecture with small discussion classes.  The goal is to give students a good understanding of the  interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science and to help them develop the ability to think and write critically about scientific research into the mind-brain.

Should a cake baker or a florist be permitted to refuse services for a gay wedding? Can a church hire and fire its ministers for any reason?  These current debates and the issues that frame them are interwoven in the American story. This course introduces students to the major texts and historical arguments underlying that story. Drawing from the respective expertise of the instructors, it exposes students to a variety of scholarly methods related to the issue: legal history and case law, intellectual history and canonical texts, social history and narrative accounts, and political philosophy and contemporary analyses.

Topics include: how plants can survive with just water, minerals and light, how they transport water astonishing distances, their unusual sex lives, why they make seeds, how they can grow nearly forever, how plants survive extreme environments without running to hide, why they synthesize caffeine, nicotine, THC and opiates, how they defend themselves from pathogens without an immune system, how they sense their environment without dedicated sensory organs, how plants have been modified by humans to provide food, fiber and fuel, and how genetically modified (GMO) crops are made and their implications to the environment and society. Overall goals are to enhance an understanding and appreciation of the plant kingdom, to help young scientists understand the primary scientific literature, and as a starting point for possible careers in plant biology. Class includes field trips to the Missouri Botanical Gardens and a local plant biotech company/institute.  Where appropriate, the class will also emphasize key differences between plants and animals. This course is primarily for first-year students interested in majoring in biology, with a possible emphasis on plants. This course is also for those that want to know more about where their food comes from, how these amazing creatures survive and flourish, and how GMO crops are engineered. Upper-level students with an interest in food and sustainable agriculture but not necessarily focusing on plants will also be welcome. Course will be lecture/discussion/hands-on format for 2 of the 3 hours per week. Students will present 20-minute papers discussing topics relevant to their interests for the remaining 1 hour (two students per class). Prerequisites: Students must have taken both biology and chemistry in high school and at least one at the AP or IP levels; or have taken Bio 2960 or Chem 111/112. This course can be taken by both first-year and upper-level undergraduates with a preference given to first-year students.",

        "Course Description": "The twin premises of this course are that humans are the subject of history, and that history should begin at the beginning.  American history courses normally begin with the colonization of the New World by Europeans beginning in the 15th century, sometimes with a cursory chapter dedicated to the 20,000 years of history that came before.  This class will invert this structure and place what we normally think of as American history in the context of a much longer story by drawing on sources from many disciplines, including archaeology, ethnography, ecology, geology, linguistics, and oral history.  We will focus on a contested events or issues, where our sources tell different stories, and consider what is at stake for defenders of different narratives.  Throughout the course, we will ask how the lack of written records limits our understanding of North American history, but also how other sources of evidence about the past can be used to include populations and themes normally underrepresented by textual histories. The goals of this course are 1) to put recent American history in its proper context; 2) to show how historical narratives are constructed and contested; and 3) to give students tools other than written records with which to construct history.

Some contend that memory sites are \"the new lunch counters,\" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice. Through our study and engagement with contested commemorative landscapes, including local, national, and global cases, students will become familiar with the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of memory studies, diverse forms and sites of commemoration, local and global efforts to advance what has been termed \"commemorative justice,\" and challenges they face.",

Why is it hard to sound romantic while speaking Klingon? What are the benefits of Lojban's attempt to rid the world of confusion and ambiguity?  This course explores the design of and motivation for constructed languages from a modern linguistic point of view. Constructed languages are those that are the result of some conscious and deliberate design rather than ones occurring naturally. We will explore the different motivations for  language construction, from the desire to create a \"perfect language\", to fictional world building, to fostering global harmony. In characterizing the different types of invented languages, students will develop familiarity with the basic tools of linguistic theory, focusing on phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Languages analyzed in detail include Klingon, Esperanto, Heptapod B, Lojban, Dothraki, Valyrian, Elvish, and various philosophical languages.  This class is only open to first-year students.",

How have these novels re-imagined our history and helped shape notions of American identity?

In fantasy and science fiction writing in particular, postapocalyptic futures and magical parallel universes are indebted frequently to a mythologized version of the medieval past. We recognize the \"medieval\" intuitively by its shining knights, dour monks, clever witches, and grimy peasants. But what do these fictions have to do, if anything, with the way the medieval world thought about itself? And why do so many modern thinkers turn to an unfamiliar past in order to question the urgent political, social, religious, and ecological concerns of the present? What, in short, does the medieval have to do with the fantastic, the unnatural, or the strange?

A geographic perspective emphasizes the spatial aspects of a variety of human and natural phenomena. This course first provides a broad understanding of the major concepts of human geography, including place, space, scale and landscape. It then utilizes these concepts to explore the distribution, diffusion and interaction of social and cultural processes across local, regional, national and global scales. Topics include language, religion, migration, population, natural resources, economic development, agriculture, and urbanization. In addition to providing a general understanding of geographic concepts, this course seeks to engender a greater appreciation of the importance of geographic perspectives in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world. No prerequisites. NOT AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN OR WHO HAVE TAKEN L61 116. Course is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

We will study the development of familiar stages in narratives of substance abuse-i.e. experimentation, transcendence, downward spiral, \"rock bottom,\" and recovery/sobriety-posing questions like: What symbolic and literal positions have addicts occupied in their societies? How has the modern pharmaceutical industry and the War on Drugs impacted perceptions of \"typical\" drug use? How do race, gender, age, class, and sexuality factor into the imagination and realities of chemical dependency? To what non-narcotic substances-e.g. media, gambling, sex, adrenaline-do we consider people addicted? We will read diverse selections of poetry, fiction, scholarship, and memoir from authors like Samuel Coleridge, William Burroughs, James Baldwin, Sherman Alexie, Denis Johnson, Irvine Welsh, Paul B. Preciado, Melissa Broder, Tao Lin, Michelle Alexander, Laurie Weeks, Mian Mian, Reginald Dwayne Betts, and Nico Walker. Through discussions and short writing assignments, we will explore various imaginations of addicts as tortured souls, creative geniuses, immature party-goers, and/or depraved monsters, seeking to better understand the way experiences of addiction shape perception, and in turn, how perceptions of addiction shape human experience.",

Chemistry has played a vital role in providing the energy needs of society, and advances in chemistry can help to develop abundant and economically viable energy technologies that do not have adverse consequences on the environment. Chemistry has long been central to the use of fossil fuel, and there remain opportunities to improve the efficiency of fossil energy resources thereby contributing to lower carbon dioxide emission per unit of energy generated. Importantly, chemistry is critical to the development of renewable energy resources, especially, solar energy for the generation of electricity and fuels. Material covered will include the challenges associated with meeting the world's increasing energy needs while reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. This class will cover the role of chemistry in energy technologies, including storage of energy.",

This course also provides a gateway for students interested in the two-year Biotech Explorers Program (BEP). The first two weeks of the course introduce students to the history of biotechnology, the BEP, and the use of case studies. The remainder of the course uses a series of four 3-week units that combine lecture material, in-class group assignments, and readings to introduce the science and scope of biotechnology. For each unit, student teams also develop short case studies of St. Louis biotech companies and present their findings to the class. A series of site-visits introduce students to the vibrant St. Louis biotech community. Limited to 16 students. Enrollment restricted to first-year students in the Biotech Explorers Program; interested sophomores can place themselves on the waitlist and may be registered on a space-available basis after BET students have been enrolled.",

        "Course Description": "In this seminar we will explore and reflect on humanities texts to understand and illuminate how American citizens evolved in their perception, use, and expectations of the natural world during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially but not limited to the practice of agriculture.  How did the mandatory short-term goals of health and economic security sought so eagerly by citizens, and supported by evolving technologies, foreshadow the unintended consequences of long-term environmental damage that would contribute to climate change, and how can we understand this using a critical and hopeful lens?  Considering contemporary writings on our perception of \"environmentalism\" will help us nuance our analysis.  Topics will include but not be limited to; agrarian democracy, settlement of the Great Plains by immigrant farmers, fragmentation of the Sioux ecosystem and the Dust Bowl era.\n \nThis cultural research will frame visits to the Tyson Research Center, Washington University's research field station in west St. Louis County.  Tyson's mission is to provide a living landscape for environmental research and education as a component of Washington University's International Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainability (InCEES).   As a class we will meet with faculty researchers (from both science and the humanities) and hear about their work on ecosystem sustainability, that is, thinking long-term for human and environmental health.\n \nClass work on the Dust Bowl era will be informed by documentaries (Roosevelt administration's, The Plow that Broke the Plains and Ken Burns' Dust Bowl) and will be followed by training with WU GIS specialist Bill Winston, enabling each student to create a StoryMap about the Dust Bowl environmental disaster.   \n \nThis course is for first-year students and sophomore students only.\n",

Their scientific contributions, however, have often been overlooked and their abilities questioned. In this year-long course, we will read biographies of famous women scientists and mathematicians, in addition to scholarly articles, to examine women's involvement in science and mathematics from the nineteenth century to the present. We will explore the ways in which women have pursued scientific knowledge, look at the cultural factors that affected them, and investigate the impact of scientific theory and social conditions on their opportunities and identities. In addition to reading about women in science, we will hear a variety of women talk about their careers. Faculty from chemistry, biology, engineering, earth and planetary sciences, medicine, physics, medical administration may visit, as well as female scientists who work in industry.

As the postwar economy deindustrialized, manufacturing moved away from the northeast and Midwest, and the suburbs grew, formerly prosperous urban centers fell into decline and remaining residents suffered the consequences. In an analysis of the economic, cultural, and spatial transformations of this period we will engage with the subjects of race and inequality, and civic and corporate attempts to recover urban space with urban renewal programs. We will also spend a significant amount of time engaging the subjects of popular culture and imagination in the reformulation of what it means to be \"urban\" in the postindustrial period, and how the suburbs exist in the greater metropolitan areas of American cities. In addition to reading, films, literature, and primary sources, will drive seminar-styled class discussion.",

We then transition to the study of collective memory, or how our memories and identities are shaped by the groups to which we belong. The topics will include transmission of memories and identity through narratives; shared historical memories; battles over how the past is to be remembered; and revision of the memories of the past to meet concerns of the present. We also consider how memory is used in political arguments. Enrollment is restricted to 19 first-year students.",

        "Course Description": "How do people whose lives have been disrupted by trauma - often by war, but also other forms of state violence - make a new home? How do differences in political and welfare state development shape the social organization of refugee incorporation? How do governments, civil society organizations, and peers shape these processes?\nWe focus primarily on three major national contexts: The US, Denmark, and Germany. Why these three states? One of our concerns is to understand how national context and within-country variation - that is, the history, political development, cultures, and contours of the welfare state model - shape the potential for persons fleeing trauma in their country of origin to resettle. This class focuses on asylum-seekers and refugees who make their way to Denmark and Germany and we use examples from the US as additional comparative case. We will examine a range of sources - from scholarly books and articles, supranational, and governmental sources, and from the artistic and journalistic projects devoted to elevating the voices of displaced persons - to gain a broad understanding of the topics at hand.\nPart of this class includes the opportunity to learn from a local partner school district striving to improve connections to students and families who arrived as refugees. As part of your coursework, you will create a project for the school district that responds to district needs. Students in this year-long Ampersand course will also have the opportunity to join an optional study trip to Morocco and Germany in May.\nCourse is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

This is the period of an emerging cultural nationalism, a great efflorescence of literature in many genres, and some of the most important political, social, and military events in modern Irish history.  One of the remarkable things about the period is the close relationship between prominent figures in the literary and artistic world and those in the realm of politics and social change.  The result was a rich cross-fertilization of ideas and attitudes which had enormous implications for the future of this embattled island nation.  We will explore this vital and transformative exchange by close attention to some primary texts of the period.

        "Course Description": "Between 1939 and 1945, Nazi troops invaded, occupied and destroyed major parts of Europe. A central aim of the Nazi project was the destruction of European Jewry, the killing of people, and the annihilation of a cultural heritage. This course seeks to deal with questions that, more than seventy years after what is now known as the Holocaust, still continue to perplex. Why did Germany turn to a dictatorship of racism, war, and mass murder? Why did the Nazis see Jews as the supreme enemy, while also targeting Poles, Ukranians, Soviets, homosexuals, the Roma, and the disabled? The course introduces students to issues that are central to understanding Nazi occupation and extermination regimes. Students will look at survival strategies in Western Europe including emigration, resistance movements in Eastern European ghettos, local residents' reactions to the murder in their midst, and non-European governments' reactions. Course is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

        "Course Description": "Course taught in English for students interested in literature and the arts; first-year students welcome. This course examines the idea of connectivity in the arts. Via novels, paintings, photography, and film, we will explore questions of interpretation related to the themes of love and betrayal; bequests and legacy; and innocence and responsibility. Mirrored paintings by Velázquez and Picasso will engage us, as will a series of works by Vermeer and other Dutch masters depicting elegant women (and their dogs) in the company of their suitors will engage us in elaborate courtship rituals played out using letters, music, and wine. We will consider how, during the reigns of Francis I and Louis XIV, the French monarchy integrated Dutch art into its collections in order to assert the king's influence and authority. Students will discuss portraits that emerge from complex tableaux in Laclos's masterful novel of seduction, DANGEROUS LIAISONS; in 19th-century paintings; and in contemporary photographs. The class will read Doerr's ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE and de Waal's HARE WITH THE AMBER EYES, stories that link history with art, the past with the present, and gifts with thefts and bereavements. We will study excerpts from Daoud's MEURSAULT INVESTIGATION in relation to the work that inspired it: Camus's STRANGER [L'ETRANGER]. Adaptation will likewise inform our readings of Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Barnes's SENSE OF AN ENDING, and the pair of films based on these novels. The class will assess aspects of the original story that are lost on screen as well as the added resonances that the novels acquire in the film versions. Same as CL 385.",

My hope is that such knowledge will enable you to better understand and assess current legal events.  I also hope that you, if you have not already done so, develop an interest in those events.  Further, this course should enable you to consider law as a future area of study and career. Interested students may continue their study in the spring semester with an optional one-credit seminar focusing on contemporary Supreme Court cases.

This course creates an opportunity for students to reflect on and engage more deeply with the narratives they share with others and tell themselves.  Social media demands that we put our stories out into the world, but how are we shaping our lives by the stories we tell?  Students will read and analyze autobiographical literature and online profiles, conduct interviews with family members, and undertake a series of reflective exercises in order to appreciate the ways knowing and owning one's story increases agency.  Texts include short works from philosophy, sociology, and psychology that engage the issue of life writing; graphic novels by Alison Bechdel and Roz Chast; personal essays and poems by writers such as James Baldwin, Amy Tan, and Kaveh Akbar; and contemporary films that model the process of self-narrative.  Students will compose a core story, interview a professional in a preferred field, and compile a portfolio that acts as a guide or compass for their college career or post-graduate life.",

        "Course Description": "This course will approach the history, culture and literature of Nazism, World War II and the Holocaust by focusing on one particular aspect of the period-the experience of children. Children as a whole were drastically affected by the policies of the Nazi regime and the war it conducted in Europe, yet different groups of children experienced the period in radically different ways, depending on who they were and where they lived. By reading key texts written for and about children, we will first take a look at how the Nazis made children-both those they considered \"Aryan\" and those they designated \"enemies\" of the German people, such as Jewish children - an important focus of their politics. We will then examine literary texts and films that depict different aspects of the experience of European children during this period: daily life in the Nazi state, the trials of war and bombardment in Germany and the experience of expulsion from the East and defeat, the increasingly restrictive sphere in which Jewish children were allowed to live, the particular difficulties children faced in the Holocaust, and the experience of children in the immediate postwar period. Readings include texts by Ruth Klüger, Harry Mulisch, Imre Kertész, Miriam Katin, David Grossman and others. Course conducted entirely in English. OPEN TO FIRST YEARS. STUDENTS MUST ENROLL IN BOTH MAIN SECTION AND A DISCUSSION SECTION. Note: course will not count towards German major or minor.",

        "Course Description": "This undergraduate seminar offers an introduction to medieval German epics, with the emphasis in medieval German romances on King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Representing a new wave of vernacular literature in late-twelfth- and early-thirteenth-century Germany, the genre of courtly romance provides key documents for the establishment of a new, refined aristocratic culture. Drawing on French models, the texts tell stories of adventure and love, but also of coming-of-age, self-realization, and the legitimization of aristocratic power. The course focuses on three of the most widely read and influential German romances, Hartmann von Aue's Erec and Iwein, Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, and the legend of the Holy Grail. Ample room will be reserved for the comparison of the German versions to related accounts in other languages, including Chrétien de Troyes and the late-medieval Middle English chivalric romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Through short introductory modules on Middle High German, the course also enables students without previous exposure to medieval German to read and interpret the texts in their original language.

Examining literary texts and artworks alongside theories of dreams and the unconscious by thinkers such as Ernst Mach and Sigmund Freud, we analyze the ways that visual artists, composers and poets sought to divulge the inner workings of the psyche. Our discussion will focus on key questions such as: what forms and what visual, aural and verbal languages were developed to represent subjective experience? How did theories of memory and trauma, and ideas about gendered psyches shape the depiction of individual agency in these works? What can these works tell us about the larger societal forces at play in this cultural moment? Readings will include the drama, poetry and novellas of Arthur Schnitzler and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, musical works by Mahler and Schoenberg, and the visual art of Gustav Klimt, Helene Funke, and Oskar Kokoschka.

        "Course Description": "This graduate seminar will examine the emergence of women writers in the German-speaking world in the critical period 1860-1932 when political, social, and economic flux provided women with ever more venues for publication and opportunity for self-expression, literary representation, and critical commentary. Beginning with the successful writer Fanny Lewald, who initially cringed at the very thought of earning money, and concluding with Vicki Baum and Irmgard Keun who succeeded on the postwar Weimar market, we will examine examples of novels, short stories, books for children, poetry, autobiographical writing, essays, and other genres by women; the venues in which these works were published; the circumstances that made this writing possible; the forces that opposed it; and the degree to which literature by women was included in contemporary conceptions of \"national literature.\"  We will pay special attention to the book industry and the expansion of readership by women and girls, whose own lives were changing as they emerged from the confines of nineteenth-century domesticity and gained new access to work, study, commerce and consumption, and politics. Select readings in gender theory and women's history will help to provide a critical apparatus with which to interpret and evaluate this work. Readings in German and English. Discussion in English.",

By studying a wide variety of primary \"texts,\" including novels, visual art, music, drama and film, we will explore the critical role that Jews played in shaping German culture from the Enlightenment to the rise of National Socialism. Topics include dialogues between the German and Jewish Enlightenments, Salon culture and the development of meaningful contacts between Germans and Jews, the intersections of aesthetic discourse and antisemitism, the rise of Yiddish theater and the visual and acoustic language of the Jewish Renaissance. Moving beyond narratives of assimilation or acculturation, we will discuss the complex and shifting nature of German-Jewish subjectivities and investigate the entanglements of German, Austrian and Jewish culture through frameworks of difference, indifference, performance, and cultural transfer. Primary readings in German, discussion in English. Accommodations can be made for interested graduate students in other programs who do not read German at the graduate level. Please see instructor.",

To answer this question, we look at two broad trends that took shape toward the end of the eighteenth century-the Enlightenment and the formation of the modern state-and we track changes and developments in Jewish life down to the close of the twentieth century with analyses of the (very different) American and Israeli settings. The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

The course reviews the evolution of Israel's foreign policy towards various actors in the international arena, including the United States, the European Union, Russia, Germany, the United Nations, and the Jewish Diaspora (with a special focus on the Jewish community in the US). The course then focuses on the Israeli-Arab conflict, stages in its development, approaches to its settlement, and its effect on Israel's foreign relations with Arab and Muslim states. Current issues in Israel's foreign policy are then discussed, including the Iranian nuclear deal, the formation of an Israeli-Sunni alliance, the BDS movement, terrorism, and prospects for a future Palestinian state. Students are tasked with applying theories of international relations to the Israeli case and examining their explanatory and predictive powers. They will also take part in a class simulation that recreates a major turning point in Israel's foreign relations.

        "Course Description": "Tensions between center and periphery; migration and rest; power and powerlessness; exile, home, and return are easily found in the historical record of both Jews and Muslims. For Muslims, it can be said that it was the very success of Islam as a world culture, and the establishment of Muslim societies in in all corners of the globe, that lay at the root of this unease.  But the disruptions of the post-colonial era, the emergence of minority Muslim communities in Europe and North America, and the recent, tragic flow of refugees following the Arab Spring have created a heightened sense of displacement and yearning for many.  \n \nOf course, the very term \"diaspora\"-from ancient Greek, meaning dispersion or scattering-has most often been used to describe the Jewish condition in the world. The themes of exile and return, catastrophe and redemption, are already woven into the Hebrew Bible and continued to be central motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity and the middle ages.  This, despite the fact that more Jews lived outside the borders of Judea than within the country many years before the destruction of Jewish sovereignty at the hands of the Romans. In the twentieth century, European imperialism, nationalisms of various types, revolution, and war-including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict-have done much to underscore the continuing dilemmas of Diaspora and home in both Jewish and Islamic identity.  \n \nThe goal of this course is to offer a comparative, historical perspective on the themes of migration and displacement, center and periphery, home and residence, exile and return, and to give students the opportunity to examine in depth some aspect of the experience of \"Diaspora\".\n\nNote: This course fulfills the capstone requirement for Jewish, Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. The course also counts as an Advanced Seminar for History. (Students wishing to receive History Advanced Seminar credit should also enroll in L22 491R section 19 for 1 unit.)

(All primary texts are read in translation.) At the same time, we explore such overarching themes as: the interplay of esoteric exegesis of the Bible and visionary experiences; the place of traditional Jewish law (halakhah) within mystical thought and practice; the role of gender, sexuality, and the body in Jewish mystical speculation and prayer; the relationship between mysticism and messianism; Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions and their mutual impact on Jewish mysticism; the \"absence of women\" from Jewish mystical movements; esoteric traditions of an elite vs. mysticism as a communal endeavor; and the tension between innovation and (the claim to) tradition in the history of Jewish mysticism.",

        "Course Description": "This course is a history of Western civilization from 3500 BC to AD 1600.  Western Civilization may be characterized as one long debate on the holy.  In no other civilization did this debate about the limits of the sacred and the profane, this constant effort at trying to grasp the divine through word and deed, last continuously for over five thousand years. To argue over the holy is to argue over the very nature of how to live a life, from the most mundane daily activity to the most sublime act of the imagination.  It is to argue over how politics, economics, art, philosophy, literature, and religion are realized in a society.  Apart from many types of polytheism, we study the three great world monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  We study the ancient cultures of north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the empires of Alexander the Great and imperial Rome, the Christianization of the Roman empire and the rise of Islam, the early medieval world in the North Sea and the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople, the formation of Latin Christendom and the papal monarchy, the crusades and the reaction of the Islamic lands, concepts of individuality,  the persecution of Jews and heretics, chivalry and peasant servitude, the Mongol Empire, the Black Death and the devastation of the fourteenth century, the renaissance in Italy and the Protestant reformation, the hunt for witches and the scientific revolution, the medieval origins of the African diaspora and the European conquest of the Americas. What defined being human, and so a man, a woman, or a child over five millennia? A fundamental question of this course is what is \"Western Civilization\" and when do the characteristics defined as \"western\" come together as coherent phenomenon?  What, then, is historical truth?  This course (through lectures, reading primary sources, discussion sections, and essay writing) gives the student a learned background in almost five thousand years of history.  Introductory course to the major and/or minor. DISCUSSION SECTION IS REQUIRED.",

        "Course Description": "South Asians have always played an integral role in the culture, history and politics of the United States. However, for complex reasons, their presence has either been concealed, or dismissed through dangerous stereotypes, or just as inaccurately, celebrated for proving the generosity of American liberalism and multiculturalism. Racially misrecognized, this large and heterogeneous group has nonetheless shaped American categories of race, sexuality, and citizenship in intriguing and powerful ways. South Asian Americans have reached to fiction, music and popular culture to craft deeply intimate and original assessments of mainstream desires. In doing so they have sought to resist the dictates of whiteness, to question US imperialism, to garner acceptance and mobility, to build solidarity with other US minorities. In this course we learn about the complex history and cultural productions of South Asians in America. How did \"South Asia\" become a category of identification, and who benefitted from that designation? What role have South Asians played in the economic, cultural and global ascendancy of the United States? How do South Asians connect with, and control, their countries of origin? What is the significance of story-telling in building the archive and questioning the fiction of South Asian America?",

This course traces and com-pares the development of police and policing in the West and East Asia over the past two centuries, highlighting the complex political, social, economic, and cultural contexts in which police evolved. We will also cover the daily lives of rank-and-file policemen, especially their interactions with elites and ordinary people. By identifying and critically analyzing the historical roots of problems plaguing con-temporary police, students will contribute to the ongoing debates over the proper roles of law enforce-ment in local communities and the best way to navigate between individual freedom and collective se-curity.",

        "Course Description": "In 1095, pope Urban II urged Christian princes to liberate the Holy Land from Muslim rule. Four years later, after enduring great hardships, the knights who had answered Urban's call conquered the city of Jerusalem. This first crusade and its accomplishments not only shaped the way future crusades were conducted, but also the way in which historians have both understood and framed the idea of a \"crusade\" as an armed pilgrimage sanctioned by the papacy to the holy land. However, the language of crusade was also invoked in campaigns against other enemies of Christendom: the long struggle to reconquer Spain from its Muslim rulers, the wars waged against pagan peoples along the Baltic Sea, and campaigns undertaken against Christian heretics and political foes of the papacy. This course aims to explore the idea of \"crusade\" and \"crusading\" over the course of the Middle Ages and raise questions about what these crusading activities meant for the participants, the public, and posterity. We will examine the causes, immediate effects, and long-term consequences of the crusades, and trace the lasting memory of crusading ideology throughout the Middle Ages and beyond.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will understand the major themes and ideas that made up the medieval crusades and how those themes and ideas changed over time. Students will be able to recognize key components that made up a crusade and identify rhetorical trends that constitute a crusading ideology. Through an examination of holy war, pilgrimage, penance, indulgences, and the like, the students will ground themselves in the very issues that historians use to understand the Middle Ages. Finally, they will also acquire some of the basic skills of the historian's craft, learning how to read primary sources critically, use them to frame an argument, and situate that argument in relation to previous scholarship.\n",

Identifying the systems that have emerged to govern modern human societies at the national and international level provides the means to consider how human beings are categorized within those systems, as citizens, subjects, asylum seekers, refugees, and the stateless. We engage a few classic works, including The Communist Manifesto, Imagined Communities, and Orientalism, and how they have transformed knowledge.

Students will examine the expectations, responsibilities and limitations women confronted in their varied roles from the Wars of Independence to the social revolutions and dictatorial regimes of the twentieth century. Besides looking at their political and economic lives, students will explore the changing gender roles and relations within marriage and the family, as well as the changing sexual and maternal mores.",

The discovery of the Americas and the coalescing of an Atlantic World would do much to transform profoundly, the common understanding of the body politics in the early-modern world. The Americas provided new models of kingship and empire; Aztecs and Incas ruled in way which both seemed familiar and strange to Spaniards' eyes. In the Caribbean, the North, and the Amazon, nomadic and semi-nomadic nations presented even more puzzling situations, where no one seemed to rule. And yet other nations, such as the Iroquois, were experimenting with new political forms. This course is thus focused on tracking this multitude of experiences from a socio-political and anthropological perspective, rather through intellectual history.",

A central aim of the Nazi project was the destruction of European Jewry, the killing of people, and the annihilation of a cultural heritage.

Why did Germany turn to a dictatorship of racism, war, and mass murder? Why did the Nazis see Jews as the supreme enemy, while also targeting Poles, Ukranians, Soviets, homosexuals, the Roma, and the disabled? The course introduces students to issues that are central to understanding Nazi occupation and extermination regimes. Students will look at survival strategies in Western Europe including emigration, resistance movements in Eastern European ghettos, local residents' reactions to the murder in their midst, and non-European governments' reactions.

The ancient Greeks and Romans had their own ideas - ideas that strike us today as both deeply alien and strikingly familiar. This course will consider questions such as: what constituted \"normal\" sex for the Greeks and for the Romans? What sex acts did they consider to be problematic or illicit, and why? What traits did the Greeks and Romans associate with masculinity? With femininity? How did society treat those who did not quite fit into those categories? How did peoples of the ancient world respond to same-sex and other-sex relationships, and was there an ancient concept of \"sexuality\"? How did issues of class, ethnicity, and age interact with and shape these concepts? How does an understanding of these issues change the way we think about sex and gender today? We will read an array of ancient texts in translation, consider various theoretical viewpoints, and move toward an understanding of what sex and gender meant in the ancient world.",

In this course, we participate in this national project of history-making by helping to excavate the queer past in the greater St. Louis region. Course readings will focus on the ways that sexual identities and communities in the United States have been shaped by urban settings since the late nineteenth century, with particular attention to the ways that race, class and gender have structured queer spaces and communities. We will pay particular attention to these processes in the St. Louis region. As part of their community-engaged learning, students will complete an oral history interview with a St. Louis LGBTQ+ community member and otherwise contribute to preserving  LGBTQ+ history in the St. Louis region.  We end the semester with a party celebrating the folks who have contributed to our oral history project.  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a community-engaged learning class, which means it combines classroom learning with work in the community. In addition to regular class time, plan to spend an additional 3-5 hours a week on community-engaged learning. Before beginning community service students must complete required training.

One of the main purposes of the course is to investigate the phenomenon of majority/minority relations, to examine the ways in which the Jewish community interacted with and experienced European societies, cultures, and politics. We will look at the dynamics of boundary formation and cultural distinctiveness; the limits of religious and social tolerance; the periodic eruption of persecution in its social, political, and religious contexts; and the prospects for Jewish integration into various European societies during the course of the Enlightenment era.",

To answer this question, we look at two broad trends that took shape toward the end of the eighteenth century-the Enlightenment and the formation of the modern state-and we track changes and developments in Jewish life down to the close of the twentieth century with analyses of the (very different) American and Israeli settings. The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

        "Course Description": "How do the most oppressed members of society challenge and sometimes overturn the status quo? Since the sixteenth century, the profitable exploitation of African-descended enslaved people drove the European colonization of the Americas in territories ranging from Virginia to Jamaica and Brazil. While enslaved people had always resisted their conditions, the institution of slavery received the most sustained challenges from below in the form of large-scale revolt and everyday resistance during the so-called \"Age of Revolutions\" (c. 1760-1830) that rocked the Atlantic world-American, French, Haitian, and Latin American. We will examine how members of the African diaspora shaped the major social, political, and cultural developments of this pivotal era in modern history through a variety of topics and themes: the significance of enslaved resistance and revolt in the creation of early American societies; the spread of news, rumor, and revolutionary ideas throughout the African diaspora; the development of racial ideologies in Enlightenment thought and culture; the emergence of abolitionist movements; and, the origins and influence of the Haitian Revolution on other slave societies, in particular the U.S. and Cuba. Students will complete this course with a strong grounding in critical and interdisciplinary historical methodologies, including in the use of cutting-edge online digital humanities resources. Students also will have the opportunity to produce historical scholarship themselves through writing an original research paper. Finally, we will consider the legacies of early Black freedom struggles to the modern Civil Rights Movement and to contemporary political concerns such as Black Lives Matter and the debates over reparations for slavery.",

In particular, this course explores cultural encounters between China and other subregions of the Eurasian continent to the north and west of China, from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the present.  The course begins by analyzing the relationship between nomadic societies on the steppe (and, more generally, \"non-state spaces\") and settled, agricultural societies such as China.  We then turn to the influence of two religions imported from central Eurasia, Buddhism and Islam.  A related theme is the relationship, in the early modern era, between trade, which tended to erode boundaries, and states, which sought to create boundaries.  We will then trace the changing dynamics among commerce, religion, and nation-states in the twentieth century.  Finally, we return to the role of Buddhism and Islam in the contemporary relationship between the China and the various peoples and states across its western frontier.",

We will explore to what extent societies build on the communist model succeeded to achieve gender equality and allow for sexual relations liberated from religious or economic constraints. Class materials examine how state socialism shaped gender roles and women's and men's lives differently, and how gays and lesbians struggled against social taboo and state repression. Students analyze the impact of modernization, industrialization, war and other conflicts on concepts of femininity and masculinity as well as on the regulation of sexuality and family relations in several Eastern European countries. We will place these dynamics within the context of broader political and cultural developments, ending with an analysis of the breakdown of socialism in the early 1990s and its impact on gender relations and the freedom of expression. The course provides students with a basic knowledge of the history of Eastern Europe and of left-wing movements active in the area, emphasizing communist ideas on women, gender equality, and non-normative sexual orientations.",

        "Course Description": "This course introduces the methods, issues, and debates that shape our understanding of economic change and development from the Industrial Revolution to the post-industrial age. Engaging economic theorists from Marx to Smith, to Weber and Wallerstein, this course problematizes the notion of rational economic actors and interrogates notions of free trade in an attempt to understand the impact of capitalism on the world. We start the course with a discussion of the \"exceptionalism\" of Great Britain as the first industrial nation and reconsider the impact of new trade, production, property and monetary/financial regimes that resulted in the so-called \"Great Divergence\" between China and the West. We then turn to the \"late industrializers\" of China, Japan, and Mexico in order to investigate the varieties of development, specifically focusing on monetary integration, legal integration and the global impact of the great depression. Continuing into the Bretton Woods Conference and the post-war international monetary systems, we bring the course to a close with the advent of the \"post-industrial age.\" This course is designed both for students specializing in economic history and students in all disciplines interested in historical approaches to political/economic development.",

In this particular class, students will be nurtured to more deeply interact with the historical past by exploring gender, race, violence, murder, crime, criminality and sexuality through three central questions explored throughout the course: What and how is African American history conducted? How do we best document the past with students fully at the intellectual table of production and preservation? How do we make history with history? These exciting and diverse interests will be pursued through in class discussions and course assigned readings that point to national archives as well as local repositories including across Missouri -local archives and the State archives, towards activating the idea of putting tangible hands on the past.",

This course uses the concept of \"information\" to rethink the history of everyday life, gender, race, bureaucracy, cities, and human bodies.

        "Course Description": "Ideas concerning the evolution of violence, crime, and criminal behavior have been framed around many different groups.  Yet, what does a typical criminal look like?  How does race - more specifically blackness - alter these conversations, inscribing greater fears about criminal behaviors?  This course taps into this reality examining the varied ways people of African descent have been and continue to be particularly imagined as a distinctly criminal population.  Taking a dual approach, students will consider the historical roots of the policing of black bodies alongside the social history of black crime while also foregrounding where and how black females fit into these critical conversations of crime and vice.  Employing a panoramic approach, students will examine historical narratives, movies and documentaries, literature, popular culture through poetry and contemporary music, as well as the prison industrial complex system. The prerequisite for the course is L90 3880(Terror and Violence in the Black Atlantic) and/or permission from the instructor, which will be determined based on a student´s past experience in courses that explore factors of race and identity.

But just how did Americans themselves go about creating the world's largest and most successful democratic republic?   And how democratic was this violent new nation that reeled from one crisis to another, and ultimately to the brink of collapse in its first seventy-five years?  This survey of American history from the creation of the Republic to the eve of the Civil War explores the Revolution and its ambiguous legacies, the starkly paradoxical \"marriage\" of slavery and freedom, and the creation of much of the America that we know; mass political parties; a powerful Presidency; sustained capitalist growth; individualistic creeds; formalized and folkloric racism; heteronormative patriarchal family life; technological innovation; literary experimentation; distinctively American legal, scientific and religious cultures; and the modern movements of labor, feminism, and African-American empowerment.

        "Course Description": "This course examines slavery and its abolition in the Middle East and North Africa from 600 C.E. to the 20th Century. It addresses slavery as a discourse and a question of political economy. We begin with an overview of slavery in late antiquity to contextualize the evolution of this practice after the rise of Islam in the region. We then examine how it was practiced, imagined, and studied under major empires, such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and the Safavids. In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of \"slave dynasties\" following a chronological order. We discuss, through primary sources, theoretical, religious, and moral debates and positions on slavery, including religious scriptures, prophetic traditions, religious law, and a plethora of narratives from a range of genres. We highlight a distinct theme each week to focus on until we conclude our discussion with the abolition of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics of discussion include various forms of male and female slavery, Qur'anic and prophetic discourse on slavery, legal and moral views on slavery, slavery as represented in religious literature, political, military, and economic structures of slavery, issues of race and gender as well as slave writings to reflect on the experiences of slavery from within.

        "Course Description": "Although today primarily associated with oil, the Arabian peninsula was for most of its history defined by water: its surrounding seas, its monsoon-driven winds, and its lack of water in its vast and forbidding interior deserts. As home to the major holy cities of Islam and a key source of global oil, the region has played an important role in the Western European and North American imagination. Despite being relatively sparsely populated, the peninsula hosts millions of believers each year on the annual Muslim pilgrimage and has been the site of major wars and military occupations by European, American, and other Middle Eastern countries for much of the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries: an outpost of the Ottoman Empire, center of British colonialism and (at Aden) an axis of its global empire, location of Egypt's \"Vietnam\" (its long war in Yemen in the 1960s), the Gulf Wars I and II, the recent wars in Yemen, to name just a few of the major conflicts. Often depicted as unchanging until caught up by the influx of massive oil wealth, this region is frequently characterized as a place of contradictions: home to some of\nthe world's largest skyscrapers and also the most inhospitable and largest sand desert in the world, known as \"the Empty Quarter\"; the location of crucial American allies and the home of al-Qa'eda founder `Usama Bin Laden. In this course, we will examine the development of the peninsula historically to understand these contradictory images. We will investigate changes in the following arenas: environment and society; colonial occupation; newly independent states;\nthe demise and development of key economic sectors (pearling, shipping; agriculture; oil; finance; piracy); political regimes; resources such as water, oil, date palms; the growth of oil extraction infrastructure and its effects on the political regimes and societies in the region; the emergence of new Gulf cities; Islamic law; women's rights; human rights debates; religious and ethnic minorities.",

        "Course Description": "This course explores the history and culture of the Sephardic diaspora from the expulsion of Spanish and Portuguese Jewry at the end of the fifteenth century to the present. We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today. Note: FIrst year students are welcome to enroll in this course.",

The course also traces how the larger world furnished the contexts of Lincoln's career, how his consciousness, speeches and writings, and presidential decisions can be understood against the backdrop of the revolutionary national democratic upheavals of the 19th century.  Finally the course will investigate how the sixteenth president, so controversial in his day, has remained a site of cultural contestation, with historians, novelists, poets, cartoonists, filmmakers, advertisers, and politicians struggling over his memory and meaning, to the present.",

In the second section we turn our attention to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which responded to the threat posed by the Protestant Reformation by reforming the Catholic church, tightening ecclesiastical discipline, improving clerical education, and defining and defending Catholic doctrine. We conclude with a consideration of the largest church council ever, Vatican II (1962-1965), which reformed the liturgy and redefined the church to meet the challenges of the modern, multicultural, post-colonial world.",

        "Course Description": "Tensions between center and periphery; migration and rest; power and powerlessness; exile, home, and return are easily found in the historical record of both Jews and Muslims. For Muslims, it can be said that it was the very success of Islam as a world culture, and the establishment of Muslim societies in in all corners of the globe, that lay at the root of this unease.  But the disruptions of the post-colonial era, the emergence of minority Muslim communities in Europe and North America, and the recent, tragic flow of refugees following the Arab Spring have created a heightened sense of displacement and yearning for many.  \n \nOf course, the very term \"diaspora\"-from ancient Greek, meaning dispersion or scattering-has most often been used to describe the Jewish condition in the world. The themes of exile and return, catastrophe and redemption, are already woven into the Hebrew Bible and continued to be central motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity and the middle ages.  This, despite the fact that more Jews lived outside the borders of Judea than within the country many years before the destruction of Jewish sovereignty at the hands of the Romans. In the twentieth century, European imperialism, nationalisms of various types, revolution, and war-including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict-have done much to underscore the continuing dilemmas of Diaspora and home in both Jewish and Islamic identity.  \n \nThe goal of this course is to offer a comparative, historical perspective on the themes of migration and displacement, center and periphery, home and residence, exile and return, and to give students the opportunity to examine in depth some aspect of the experience of \"Diaspora\".\n\nNote: This course fulfills the capstone requirement for Jewish, Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. The course also counts as an Advanced Seminar for History. (Students wishing to receive History Advanced Seminar credit should also enroll in L22 491R section 19 for 1 unit.)

Is Jewish mysticism just one form of a general phenomenon common to a variety of religious traditions or is it a specific interpretation of biblical, rabbinic, and other Jewish traditions? Taking the above questions as a starting point, this course aims at a systematic and historically contextualized analysis of a broad range of Jewish texts that are commonly classified as \"mystical\". (All primary texts are read in translation.) At the same time, we explore such overarching themes as: the interplay of esoteric exegesis of the Bible and visionary experiences; the place of traditional Jewish law (halakhah) within mystical thought and practice; the role of gender, sexuality, and the body in Jewish mystical speculation and prayer; the relationship between mysticism and messianism; Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions and their mutual impact on Jewish mysticism; the \"absence of women\" from Jewish mystical movements; esoteric traditions of an elite vs. mysticism as a communal endeavor; and the tension between innovation and (the claim to) tradition in the history of Jewish mysticism.",

Topics include: the urban political economy, the cultural dynamics of modernity, the reconstruction of traditions in the making of modernity, the cultural production and consumption, colonialism and imperialism in the urban setting, nationalism, and reform and revolution. Acknowledging and understanding the nuance and difference in views and interpretations in historical writings (historiography) are essential. The course seeks to develop students' research and analytical skills, such as locating secondary sources, incorporating scholarly interpretations, and developing and sustaining a thesis based on secondary and primary sources in student research. Prereqs: This is an interdisciplinary seminar designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Advanced undergraduate students must have taken at least one China-related course at the 300-level or higher.",

It registered four \"great revolutions\": Mexico 1910, Bolivia 1952, Cuba 1959, and Nicaragua 1979. These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted. With the exception perhaps of the Bolivian Revolution, these revolutions had a profound impact on Latin American and world politics. The primary aim of this course is to analyze and compare the causes, processes, and outcomes of the Mexican, Cuban, and Nicaraguan revolutions.",

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more. In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports. Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century. Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising. This portion of the course will include a viewing of the iconic 1931 Boris Karloff film, which established indelible versions of the mad scientist and his \"monster.\" Students in this seminar will be supported in developing individual final projects of their own design. For the English major, this course satisfies the Nineteenth Century requirement.",

Jews constituted a classic, nearly continuous minority in the premodern Christian world-a world that was not known for tolerating dissent. Or was it?  One of the main purposes of the course is to investigate the phenomenon of majority/minority relations, to examine the ways in which the Jewish community interacted with and experienced European societies, cultures, and politics.

To answer this question, we look at two broad trends that took shape toward the end of the eighteenth century-the Enlightenment and the formation of the modern state-and we track changes and developments in Jewish life down to the close of the twentieth century with analyses of the (very different) American and Israeli settings. The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

How did STS in East Asia change from the early twentieth century onward? What are the main historiographical trends in writing East Asian sciences? And what kinds of questions are left unexplored? This course will in particular focus on the transformation from the early modern to the modern period (ca. 1600 to 2000), during which the organization of natural knowledge in East Asia witnessed a significant reconfiguration. Situating historical change at the intersection of local and global dynamics, this course will introduce a variety of subjects including histories\nof epistemology, technologies of governance, global circuits of knowledge transfer, the uneasy ties between colonialism and modern science, and issues around energy, infrastructure, and environment. Apart from familiarizing themselves with the history of science and technology, students will also obtain a firm grasp of historiographical and methodological problems that pertain to STS in East Asia from Joseph Needham's groundbreaking works to post-Needham critiques, to more recent debates around capitalism, science, and technology.",

        "Course Description": "Although today primarily associated with oil, the Arabian peninsula was for most of its history defined by water: its surrounding seas, its monsoon-driven winds, and its lack of water in its vast and forbidding interior deserts. As home to the major holy cities of Islam and a key source of global oil, the region has played an important role in the Western European and North American imagination. Despite being relatively sparsely populated, the peninsula hosts millions of believers each year on the annual Muslim pilgrimage and has been the site of major wars and military occupations by European, American, and other Middle Eastern countries for much of the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries: an outpost of the Ottoman Empire, center of British colonialism and (at Aden) an axis of its global empire, location of Egypt's \"Vietnam\" (its long war in Yemen in the 1960s), the Gulf Wars I and II, the recent wars in Yemen, to name just a few of the major conflicts. Often depicted as unchanging until caught up by the influx of massive oil wealth, this region is frequently characterized as a place of contradictions: home to some of\nthe world's largest skyscrapers and also the most inhospitable and largest sand desert in the world, known as \"the Empty Quarter\"; the location of crucial American allies and the home of al-Qa'eda founder `Usama Bin Laden. In this course, we will examine the development of the peninsula historically to understand these contradictory images. We will investigate changes in the following arenas: environment and society; colonial occupation; newly independent states;\nthe demise and development of key economic sectors (pearling, shipping; agriculture; oil; finance; piracy); political regimes; resources such as water, oil, date palms; the growth of oil extraction infrastructure and its effects on the political regimes and societies in the region; the emergence of new Gulf cities; Islamic law; women's rights; human rights debates; religious and ethnic minorities.",

How, why, and by whom were they granted special status as Scripture? What other books were rejected? We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures? Students unfamiliar with these sacred canons will gain a familiarity with their contents and cultural contexts, while those who already know one or more of them will inevitably discover new insights into their inter-relationship and subtle, often startling contents.",

In addition to literary works, the course will engage with two or three important models of critical practice e.g. Wollstonecraft's \"Vindication of the Rights of Woman,\" Marx's \"German Ideology,\" Freud's \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" T.S.

This course, intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, traces the transformation of Central Asia from Genghis Khan's thirteenth century conquests to the present, covering the territories of former Soviet Central Asia, Western China (Xinjiang), and Afghanistan. Although the course covers nearly a thousand years, the primary emphasis is on imperial schemes and transformations of the past 300 years. All readings will be in English, and no prior knowledge in Central Asian history is expected or required.",

Students will work with public databases, visit local museums, and comb local archives in an effort to recover what we can of the industry of enslavement in St. Louis, to map it onto the streets of contemporary St. Louis, to document slave ownership on maps of St. Louis County, and, to the extent possible, to begin to recover what we can of the lives of individual persons enslaved in St. Louis county. After being introduced to the available resources that we will use to tackle these different projects, students assign themselves to teams tackling each. Over the course of the semester, we will also read background literature on the history of enslavement in the Americas, slave narratives, autobiographies, and biographies, and histories of the St. Louis region while sampling online and video resources as appropriate. We will also read literature on the place of historical, archival, and digital work in shaping our public engagement with this past and envisioning a collective future in light of it.",

The social, ethnic, and religious diversity, and the political and gender-related complexities of the Vietnamese are typically neglected. By focusing almost exclusively on Vietnam, US narratives of the war also tend to gloss over the wider regional dimensions of the conflict. In the interest of redressing this imbalance, this course examines the outlook, values, agency, and experiences of northern and southern Vietnamese, as well as rural and urban Cambodians and Laotians. Drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary sources it provides a macro and micro level historical analysis of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos from the premodern era until the present. In so doing, it explores the early sociocultural foundations of ancient Southeast Asian civilizations, the impact of Chinese and French colonialism, and Japanese occupation, the rise of Indochinese nationalist and communist revolutionary movements, the process of decolonization, the impact of U.S. military intervention, the rise and fall of the Khmer Rouge, postwar political and economic developments, and the memories and multiple meanings of the Vietnam Wars for Southeast Asians.

How do differences in political and welfare state development shape the social organization of refugee incorporation? How do governments, civil society organizations, and peers shape these processes?\nWe focus primarily on three major national contexts: The US, Denmark, and Germany. Why these three states? One of our concerns is to understand how national context and within-country variation - that is, the history, political development, cultures, and contours of the welfare state model - shape the potential for persons fleeing trauma in their country of origin to resettle. This class focuses on asylum-seekers and refugees who make their way to Denmark and Germany and we use examples from the US as additional comparative case. We will examine a range of sources - from scholarly books and articles, supranational, and governmental sources, and from the artistic and journalistic projects devoted to elevating the voices of displaced persons - to gain a broad understanding of the topics at hand.\nPart of this class includes the opportunity to learn from a local partner school district striving to improve connections to students and families who arrived as refugees. As part of your coursework, you will create a project for the school district that responds to district needs. Students in this year-long Ampersand course will also have the opportunity to join an optional study trip to Morocco and Germany in May.\nCourse is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

A central aim of the Nazi project was the destruction of European Jewry, the killing of people, and the annihilation of a cultural heritage. This course seeks to deal with questions that, more than seventy years after what is now known as the Holocaust, still continue to perplex. Why did Germany turn to a dictatorship of racism, war, and mass murder? Why did the Nazis see Jews as the supreme enemy, while also targeting Poles, Ukranians, Soviets, homosexuals, the Roma, and the disabled? The course introduces students to issues that are central to understanding Nazi occupation and extermination regimes. Students will look at survival strategies in Western Europe including emigration, resistance movements in Eastern European ghettos, local residents' reactions to the murder in their midst, and non-European governments' reactions.

        "Course Description": "The ritual act of taking refuge plays an important role throughout various Buddhist traditions. In this class, we will use this idea as a helpful framework to examine Buddhist doctrines, ideas, theories, and practices. We will attempt to understand what role various forms of media and their ritualistic appropriations played in Buddhist responses to the question of \"how can we end human suffering?\" To do so, we will observe four different ways in which practitioners took refuge in the Buddha. In the first section \"Taking Refuge in the Life of the Buddha,\" we will explore how practitioners attempted to emulate aspects of the Buddha's life stories (jataka). In the second section \"Taking Refuge in the Body of the Buddha,\" we will engage in the practice of relic veneration and its relationship to the Buddha's life stories. In the third section \"Taking Refuge in the Words of the Buddha,\" we will delve into the world of powerful scriptures and their ornamentation, production, and veneration. And in the last section \"Taking Refuge in the Realms of the Buddha,\" we will investigate Buddhist sacred geography and various forms of ma??alas. At the end, this course will offer you many different responses to the problem of human suffering that various Buddhist communities had developed. By surveying these distinct responses, we will realize that \"Buddhism\" is a conglomeration of quite rich and diverse practices and ideas, offering a plethora of sometimes concurring solutions to the problem of human suffering. At the same time, however, we will recognize recurrent themes and similar ritualistic appropriations of mixed media cultural objects that obviously transcended national, congregational, and disciplinary boundaries. In that sense, the heuristic framework of taking refuge in the Buddha allows us to see some continuity in the discontinuous development of Buddhist traditions, their material culture, and ritualistic performances.",

How are World War II, Italy's Fascist past, its anti-Semitism, and civil war being remembered (or forgotten) to this day? What is Neo-fascism? In this course, you will try to answer these and other questions by looking at different aspects of Italian culture from the Fascist regime and post-war years until today. You will read Fascist propaganda, Resistance songs, short stories of the literary Neorealism, Primo Levi's personal narratives, and the writings of female partisans. You will then explore how Italy's complicated past is being dealt with at both the individual and the collective level (in art and architecture, in museums and memorials, schools and social media), and how the tragedy of World War II is being represented and re-imagined in Italian contemporary fiction and films. You will consider issues such as the relationship between testimony and memory, between history and fiction, and how notions of post-memory, forgiveness, and revenge shape Italy's national identity.

        "Course Description": "This course will approach the history, culture and literature of Nazism, World War II and the Holocaust by focusing on one particular aspect of the period-the experience of children. Children as a whole were drastically affected by the policies of the Nazi regime and the war it conducted in Europe, yet different groups of children experienced the period in radically different ways, depending on who they were and where they lived. By reading key texts written for and about children, we will first take a look at how the Nazis made children-both those they considered \"Aryan\" and those they designated \"enemies\" of the German people, such as Jewish children - an important focus of their politics. We will then examine literary texts and films that depict different aspects of the experience of European children during this period: daily life in the Nazi state, the trials of war and bombardment in Germany and the experience of expulsion from the East and defeat, the increasingly restrictive sphere in which Jewish children were allowed to live, the particular difficulties children faced in the Holocaust, and the experience of children in the immediate postwar period. Readings include texts by Ruth Klüger, Harry Mulisch, Imre Kertész, Miriam Katin, David Grossman and others. Course conducted entirely in English. OPEN TO FIRST YEARS.

To answer this question, we look at two broad trends that took shape toward the end of the eighteenth century-the Enlightenment and the formation of the modern state-and we track changes and developments in Jewish life down to the close of the twentieth century with analyses of the (very different) American and Israeli settings. The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

In particular, this course explores cultural encounters between China and other subregions of the Eurasian continent to the north and west of China, from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the present.  The course begins by analyzing the relationship between nomadic societies on the steppe (and, more generally, \"non-state spaces\") and settled, agricultural societies such as China.  We then turn to the influence of two religions imported from central Eurasia, Buddhism and Islam.  A related theme is the relationship, in the early modern era, between trade, which tended to erode boundaries, and states, which sought to create boundaries.  We will then trace the changing dynamics among commerce, religion, and nation-states in the twentieth century.  Finally, we return to the role of Buddhism and Islam in the contemporary relationship between the China and the various peoples and states across its western frontier.",

During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization.  From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation.  By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultural production.  In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation.  How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self?  And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?  Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature.  This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.  All literary texts are in English translation and no previous knowledge of Korean is required.",

This course will introduce some of the foundational responses to this dominance, both literary and theoretical, by the colonized and their descendants. We will examine literary works that engage with postcolonial critique by authors such as V.S. Naipaul, Raja Rao, George Lamming, Doris Lessing, and N'gugi wa Thiong'o, as well as important critiques of colonialism by a variety of influential thinkers. Overall, the course will investigate how literature might have helped consolidate Empire, as well as ways in which it saw itself as a key mode of rebellion against imperial power, and we will end by considering how the urgent issues of postcolonial literature - race, gender, language, nationalism, identity - continue to haunt today's global literature.

        "Course Description": "Cleopatra, queen of the Nile, has become famous for her romantic liaisons, political maneuvering, and her death by snake bite. Yet Cleopatra was also a formidable military strategist, a powerful leader who studied medicine and spoke nearly a dozen languages. Most importantly, Cleopatra was the prototype for depicting strong women on the throne. This course will explore how Early Modern writers re-imagined Cleopatra in the Renaissance, a time which saw another strong queen, Elizabeth I, rise to power. We will pay special attention to how writers used Cleopatra to engage with Early Modern issues of globalization, gender, history, and politics. Finally, we will think about how Shakespeare and his contemporaries contrasted the exotic and sometimes scandalous Cleopatra with the virginal Queen Elizabeth. Readings may include works by Cicero, Lucan, Plutarch, and Virgil from antiquity; and plays by Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Daniel, Brandon, Elizabeth Cary, Fletcher, Dryden, and Shakespeare as well as the writings of Queen Elizabeth from the Renaissance.  3 short responses; midterm and final papers; and a presentation introducing one of the assigned readings. First-year and/or students with no prior knowledge of this topic are encouraged to enroll. Satisfies the Early Modern requirement.",

We will explore to what extent societies build on the communist model succeeded to achieve gender equality and allow for sexual relations liberated from religious or economic constraints. Class materials examine how state socialism shaped gender roles and women's and men's lives differently, and how gays and lesbians struggled against social taboo and state repression. Students analyze the impact of modernization, industrialization, war and other conflicts on concepts of femininity and masculinity as well as on the regulation of sexuality and family relations in several Eastern European countries. We will place these dynamics within the context of broader political and cultural developments, ending with an analysis of the breakdown of socialism in the early 1990s and its impact on gender relations and the freedom of expression. The course provides students with a basic knowledge of the history of Eastern Europe and of left-wing movements active in the area, emphasizing communist ideas on women, gender equality, and non-normative sexual orientations.",

        "Course Description": "Among the many profound changes that have occurred in the Muslim World since the nineteenth century, one of the most transformative is that which academics popularly term the \"crisis of religious authority.\" According to the academic narrative, as modern nation states emerged in the nineteenth century they created vast bureaucracies, universal compulsory education systems, new judicial structures, and other institutions. One of the key consequences of these changes was the marginalization of the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, who up until that time had enjoyed almost unparalleled authority to define Islamic social norms for the masses, dispense justice through the courts, educate the elites, and so on. Mass education, increased access to Islamic texts, and new technologies of disruption such as the internet have allowed new actors ranging from fundamentalists to feminists to emerge and challenge the Muslim scholarly elite's monopoly on the authoritative interpretation of Islam. Today, the so-called crisis of religious authority in Islam is cited as a cause for all manner of developments ranging from terrorism to increased gender equality. However, there has never been an institutionalized clerical hierarchy in Islam, and religious authority is not simply 'had' or claimed in a straightforward manner. Instead, in different times and places different actors have reworked traditional modes of claiming authority and taken advantage of new technologies to promote their own interpretations of Islamic texts and norms as authoritative while challenging the claims of others. Our approach to exploring religious authority in Islam and its modern crisis will be both thematic and chronological. We will consider how the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, have historically laid claim to be the authoritative voices of Islam, and how they have responded to new challenges. We will then consider how the modern state and new developments have produced new actors who have sought to promulgate their own authoritative claims about Islamic texts and practices. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of the different modes of argumentation and techniques used by a range of actors to claim Islamic authority. They will acquire the skills to critically analyze how competing arguments are constructed in relation to modern debates and issues such as the rise of ISIS and new developments in Islamic Feminism. We will conclude by considering why established religious authority and its dissolution is so often considered both the cause of, and solution to, so many of the social ills in the Muslim World.",

Beginning with Romanticism's self-conscious break with the past, we'll study the rise of bourgeois melodrama with its intensely emotional rendering of character and spectacular effects.  We'll consider how those effects were made possible by advances in industrial stage technology which reproduced the everyday world with unprecedented verisimilitude, and how playwrights responded to those technologies by calling for the theatre to become either a \"total work of art\"--plunging its spectators into a mythical realm--or a petri dish--analyzing the struggles of the modern individual within his or her modern milieu.  Exploring a range of aesthetic modes--including Realism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Expressionism, the Epic Theatre, and the Theatre of the Absurd--we will read classic plays by modern playwrights to consider how the modern theatre helped its audiences understand as well as adapt to the rapidly changing conditions of the modern world.",

Authors might include Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov, Gippius, Teffi, Tsvetaeva, Platonov, Bunin, Nabokov, and others.  Some of the questions we explore: Is a short story (rasskaz) just a shorter piece of fiction or does it aim to do something very different from a novel? How did the Russians develop-and maybe change-the genre? In what ways are these stories connected to the place and time in which they were written? We will read one or two short stories a week.

Today, Chinese Americans are the American society's most productive and responsible citizens. From coolie to Fu Manchu, from Charlie Chan to the model minority, from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from Kung Fu Panda to Yo-Yo Ma, this series of images tells some of the stories of the dynamics between immigrants and the local residents and the Chinese Americans' journey of assimilation. In this course, we will trace this historical trajectory by way of writers' and filmmakers' imagination and representation of the experiences of those Chinese who left their homeland in search for means to build a better life for their children back in the home country or here in the adopted land. We will explore questions such as: How do the Chinese diaspora long for their cultural origin \"China\" in their various lengths of living abroad? Does diaspora have an expiration date? Through works by writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Gish Jen and Ha Jin, and filmmakers such as Wayne Wang and Ang Lee, we will also examine issues of community building, the politics of hyphenation (Asian-American, inter-national, pan-Asian, etc.), and the role of gender in identity construction.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines slavery and its abolition in the Middle East and North Africa from 600 C.E. to the 20th Century. It addresses slavery as a discourse and a question of political economy. We begin with an overview of slavery in late antiquity to contextualize the evolution of this practice after the rise of Islam in the region. We then examine how it was practiced, imagined, and studied under major empires, such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and the Safavids. In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of \"slave dynasties\" following a chronological order. We discuss, through primary sources, theoretical, religious, and moral debates and positions on slavery, including religious scriptures, prophetic traditions, religious law, and a plethora of narratives from a range of genres. We highlight a distinct theme each week to focus on until we conclude our discussion with the abolition of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics of discussion include various forms of male and female slavery, Qur'anic and prophetic discourse on slavery, legal and moral views on slavery, slavery as represented in religious literature, political, military, and economic structures of slavery, issues of race and gender as well as slave writings to reflect on the experiences of slavery from within. The goal is to enable students to understand the histories of slavery in the Middle East and eventually compare it to that of other regions and cultures, such as European and Atlantic slavery.

        "Course Description": "This course will explore the rise of civilization in the broad region of Eurasia, spanning from the eastern edges of Europe to the western edges of China.  The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250).  In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

        "Course Description": "Although today primarily associated with oil, the Arabian peninsula was for most of its history defined by water: its surrounding seas, its monsoon-driven winds, and its lack of water in its vast and forbidding interior deserts. As home to the major holy cities of Islam and a key source of global oil, the region has played an important role in the Western European and North American imagination. Despite being relatively sparsely populated, the peninsula hosts millions of believers each year on the annual Muslim pilgrimage and has been the site of major wars and military occupations by European, American, and other Middle Eastern countries for much of the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries: an outpost of the Ottoman Empire, center of British colonialism and (at Aden) an axis of its global empire, location of Egypt's \"Vietnam\" (its long war in Yemen in the 1960s), the Gulf Wars I and II, the recent wars in Yemen, to name just a few of the major conflicts. Often depicted as unchanging until caught up by the influx of massive oil wealth, this region is frequently characterized as a place of contradictions: home to some of\nthe world's largest skyscrapers and also the most inhospitable and largest sand desert in the world, known as \"the Empty Quarter\"; the location of crucial American allies and the home of al-Qa'eda founder `Usama Bin Laden. In this course, we will examine the development of the peninsula historically to understand these contradictory images. We will investigate changes in the following arenas: environment and society; colonial occupation; newly independent states;\nthe demise and development of key economic sectors (pearling, shipping; agriculture; oil; finance; piracy); political regimes; resources such as water, oil, date palms; the growth of oil extraction infrastructure and its effects on the political regimes and societies in the region; the emergence of new Gulf cities; Islamic law; women's rights; human rights debates; religious and ethnic minorities.",

Dada's emergence in Zürich and New York in the midst of the First World War set the tone for its stress on irrationality as an oppositional strategy. Surrealist research into the domain of the unconscious continued this extreme challenge to dominant culture, but in a revolutionary spirit that proposed new possibilities for personal and collective liberation. The international character of the movements, with substantial cross-transmission between Europe and the United States, will be emphasized.

Our investigation looks into the 1.5- and second-generation youth of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds in the United States (with a considerable number of case studies focusing on Asian Americans and Latinx).  Discussion topics include migration and identity, ethnicity and race, bilingualism and biculturalism, family and school, youth culture, and other pressing issues such as mental health.  The seminar offers a theoretical lens into children of immigrants by introducing different research methodologies in the social sciences.  Students are required to conduct an individual research project among a selected group of children of immigrants.",

        "Course Description": "Tensions between center and periphery; migration and rest; power and powerlessness; exile, home, and return are easily found in the historical record of both Jews and Muslims. For Muslims, it can be said that it was the very success of Islam as a world culture, and the establishment of Muslim societies in in all corners of the globe, that lay at the root of this unease.  But the disruptions of the post-colonial era, the emergence of minority Muslim communities in Europe and North America, and the recent, tragic flow of refugees following the Arab Spring have created a heightened sense of displacement and yearning for many.  \n \nOf course, the very term \"diaspora\"-from ancient Greek, meaning dispersion or scattering-has most often been used to describe the Jewish condition in the world. The themes of exile and return, catastrophe and redemption, are already woven into the Hebrew Bible and continued to be central motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity and the middle ages.  This, despite the fact that more Jews lived outside the borders of Judea than within the country many years before the destruction of Jewish sovereignty at the hands of the Romans. In the twentieth century, European imperialism, nationalisms of various types, revolution, and war-including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict-have done much to underscore the continuing dilemmas of Diaspora and home in both Jewish and Islamic identity.  \n \nThe goal of this course is to offer a comparative, historical perspective on the themes of migration and displacement, center and periphery, home and residence, exile and return, and to give students the opportunity to examine in depth some aspect of the experience of \"Diaspora\".\n\nNote: This course fulfills the capstone requirement for Jewish, Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. The course also counts as an Advanced Seminar for History. (Students wishing to receive History Advanced Seminar credit should also enroll in L22 491R section 19 for 1 unit.) The course is open to advanced undergraduate and graduate students.",

This course undertakes a pathology of these tropes in Italian literary history and seeks to understand their meaning for the changing Italian cultural identity across time and the Italian peninsula.

Other topics covered include the cultural construction of AIDS and risk, government responses to HIV/AIDS, origin and transmission debates, ethics and responsibilities, drug testing and marketing, the making of the AIDS industry and \"risk\" categories, prevention and education strategies, interaction between bio-medicine and alternative healing systems, and medical advances and hopes.",

Throughout, we will be mindful of 1) how gender functions in tandem with sexuality, class, race, religion, and ethnicity (intersectionality) and 2) how multidimensional identities morph historically, regionally, and culturally. The student builds a gender analysis toolkit and practices what Cynthia Enloe describes as \"feminist curiosity,\" exploring the relationship between gender and power in various aspects of international affairs.",

Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites.

The course and meetings provide student delegates with a unique educational experience to observe the development of international climate policy through interdisciplinary negotiations and interactions inside the negotiating space. Students see the interaction between climate policy, science and technology as they identify and analyze policy decisions across the international climate regime. The number of students who can attend meetings is limited by the United Nations. We will do our best to have course participants attend either the COP or Subsidiary Body meetings. Students attend one week. The COP 26 meeting will be held in Glasgow, Scotland from November 9 - 19, 2020.  The Subsidiary Body meetings will be in Bonn, Germany from May 31 - June 10, 2021. Enrollment is limited. Indicate your interest by placing yourself on the waitlist (registering for 3 credits) and completing an application. All students will be placed on the waitlist upon registration and students will be selected to enroll from the waitlist after all the applications are reviewed. The application will be open in early March and will be available on the course website https://sites.wustl.edu/wustlcop/ and on the Climate Change Program website at climatechange.wustl.edu. Application review will begin April 12. Interviews will take place between April 17 and April 24, and enrollment decisions will be made by April 27.

It registered four \"great revolutions\": Mexico 1910, Bolivia 1952, Cuba 1959, and Nicaragua 1979. These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted. With the exception perhaps of the Bolivian Revolution, these revolutions had a profound impact on Latin American and world politics. The primary aim of this course is to analyze and compare the causes, processes, and outcomes of the Mexican, Cuban, and Nicaraguan revolutions.",

Topics to be discussed in class include universal cognitive operations, individual learner differences, text types and literary forms, literacy and social power, and the extent to which reading and writing are interrelated. Students will discuss how to bridge scientific research in the laboratory to practice and will be involved in St. Louis community outreach projects with refugees and immigrants at the International Institute, where they will create and implement reading and writing activities driven by theory and empirical investigations. Students will take the theory and research they learn and will help meet the local reading and writing needs of a changing population with a variety of backgrounds, values and educational preparations. The course is required for the minor in applied linguistics, the PhD in Applied Linguistics, and the graduate certificate in language instruction.

Alternating between the U.S. and France, it begins in the years before World War I and concludes with the rise of virulent forms of cultural nationalism in the late 1930s. We consider the subjects, personalities, aesthetic strategies, and political and social investments associated with these alternative modernisms, linked to a search for roots, on the one hand, and on the other, to a desire for forms of spatial and social mobility. Comparing 'homegrown' and expatriate experience, we will consider divergent attitudes toward identity, gender, nation, time, and nature, analyzing these two fundamental responses to modernity in relation to one another.

How are World War II, Italy's Fascist past, its anti-Semitism, and civil war being remembered (or forgotten) to this day? What is Neo-fascism? In this course, you will try to answer these and other questions by looking at different aspects of Italian culture from the Fascist regime and post-war years until today. You will read Fascist propaganda, Resistance songs, short stories of the literary Neorealism, Primo Levi's personal narratives, and the writings of female partisans. You will then explore how Italy's complicated past is being dealt with at both the individual and the collective level (in art and architecture, in museums and memorials, schools and social media), and how the tragedy of World War II is being represented and re-imagined in Italian contemporary fiction and films. You will consider issues such as the relationship between testimony and memory, between history and fiction, and how notions of post-memory, forgiveness, and revenge shape Italy's national identity.

From the ghastly 1348 plague that frames Boccaccio's Decameron to the midday madness of errant Renaissance knights, from 16th-century tales of poisoning and 19th-century Pirandellian madmen to the contemporary scourge of mafia killings, disease, madness and death are dominant facts of reality, points of view, symbols, and cultural characteristics of Italian poetry and prose. This course undertakes a pathology of these tropes in Italian literary history and seeks to understand their meaning for the changing Italian cultural identity across time and the Italian peninsula. We will read primary literary texts and view excerpts from films alongside articles focused on the cultural history of medicine, religion, and criminal justice. Taught in English. No Final.",

Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites. No prior knowledge of East Asian culture or language necessary. Required Screenings: Tuesdays @ 4pm\n",

        "Course Description": "Writers in Japan, as elsewhere, have fashioned accounts of childhood and youth- both fictive and autobiographical, in prose and verse- over the centuries. This course will explore the range and diversity of Japan's literature of reminiscence, with a focus on the modern period and the work of writers such as Natsume Sôseki, Tanizaki Jun'ichirô, Kôda Aya, Yasuoka Shôtarô, and Kita Morio. Our readings will be placed in the context of Japan's social and economic transformations, its imperial nationhood, and the dramatically-shifting postwar and contemporary period. A selection of comparative examples drawn from other Asian and Western literatures will serve to broaden our focus, consider affinities and differences, and thereby enrich our class discussion.  No Japanese language background is required. Prerequisite: upper-class standing and at least one course focusing on Japan, or permission of instructor.",

Coptic was the vernacular language spoken and written in Egypt during the Roman, Byzantine, and Arab periods (until about 1300 CE) and as such is important for studying the history of pre-modern Egypt. It preserves some of the oldest known translations of the Bible, many apoc­ryphal and \"heretical\" books that illustrate the wide diversity of ancient Christianity (e.g., the Gospels of Thomas and Mary), as well as sermons, saints lives, monastic instructions, and liturgical manuals that still constitute the literary culture of the Coptic Orthodox Church today. In addition, a plethora of \"magical\" papyri illustrate medical and religious practices; personal letters reveal the lives of everyday people; and hordes of business documents (contracts, wills, governmental petitions, receipts, etc.) have proved important for understanding Roman and Byzantine economies. As Roman Egypt was a highly bilingual society, there are even instances of Classical Greek literature translated into Coptic (e.g., selections of Homer and Plato), which offer a unique witness to how such texts were received by Egyptians. Our goal this semester is to cover fifteen of twenty lessons in the grammar book. The remainder will be covered in the second semester.",

        "Course Description": "South Asians have always played an integral role in the culture, history and politics of the United States. However, for complex reasons, their presence has either been concealed, or dismissed through dangerous stereotypes, or just as inaccurately, celebrated for proving the generosity of American liberalism and multiculturalism. Racially misrecognized, this large and heterogeneous group has nonetheless shaped American categories of race, sexuality, and citizenship in intriguing and powerful ways. South Asian Americans have reached to fiction, music and popular culture to craft deeply intimate and original assessments of mainstream desires. In doing so they have sought to resist the dictates of whiteness, to question US imperialism, to garner acceptance and mobility, to build solidarity with other US minorities. In this course we learn about the complex history and cultural productions of South Asians in America. How did \"South Asia\" become a category of identification, and who benefitted from that designation? What role have South Asians played in the economic, cultural and global ascendancy of the United States? How do South Asians connect with, and control, their countries of origin? What is the significance of story-telling in building the archive and questioning the fiction of South Asian America?",

How, why, and by whom were they granted special status as Scripture? What other books were rejected? We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures? Students unfamiliar with these sacred canons will gain a familiarity with their contents and cultural contexts, while those who already know one or more of them will inevitably discover new insights into their inter-relationship and subtle, often startling contents.",

A central aim of the Nazi project was the destruction of European Jewry, the killing of people, and the annihilation of a cultural heritage. This course seeks to deal with questions that, more than seventy years after what is now known as the Holocaust, still continue to perplex. Why did Germany turn to a dictatorship of racism, war, and mass murder? Why did the Nazis see Jews as the supreme enemy, while also targeting Poles, Ukranians, Soviets, homosexuals, the Roma, and the disabled? The course introduces students to issues that are central to understanding Nazi occupation and extermination regimes. Students will look at survival strategies in Western Europe including emigration, resistance movements in Eastern European ghettos, local residents' reactions to the murder in their midst, and non-European governments' reactions. Course is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

        "Course Description": "The presence of Muslim minorities in the West is increasingly divisive across the US and Europe as political leaders appeal to voters' fear of the 'Other' to promote Islamophobic agendas that reshape immigration and asylum policies and redefine Western identity as Christian. Politicians further exploit the rise of extremist groups like ISIS to justify anti-Muslim rhetoric and critique multiculturalism, claiming that Islam and the West are inherently antithetical. In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century. We also analyze public US debates on the boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.",

Through this interdisciplinary course on culture, design, religion and society, students will be introduced to and gain a deeper insight into the rich diversity of South Asia through the study of the architecture of its significant sacred places.We will take a journey through the Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Temples; the Islamic Mosque; the Sikh Gurudwara; the Zoroastrian Fire Temple; the Jewish Synagogue; and the Christian Church, tracing the evolution of these places of worship from the Indus Valley Civilization to Pre-Colonial times. Through visuals, readings, and discussions, students will learn about the different architectural styles and motifs used in sacred buildings and how they came about. We will explore the inter-relationships between the design elements through the lens of political, social, religious, regional and technological influences and understand the ways in which evolving design principles reflect these influences overtime.\nAt the end of the semester, students will go on a field trip to experience the diverse sacred architecture in the St. Louis region.\n\nThis course will be of interest to students of languages and cultures, architecture, archeology,  art history, history, preservation, religion, and South Asian culture, among others. \n\nNo prior knowledge of architecture or the history of this region is required.",

Children as a whole were drastically affected by the policies of the Nazi regime and the war it conducted in Europe, yet different groups of children experienced the period in radically different ways, depending on who they were and where they lived. By reading key texts written for and about children, we will first take a look at how the Nazis made children-both those they considered \"Aryan\" and those they designated \"enemies\" of the German people, such as Jewish children - an important focus of their politics. We will then examine literary texts and films that depict different aspects of the experience of European children during this period: daily life in the Nazi state, the trials of war and bombardment in Germany and the experience of expulsion from the East and defeat, the increasingly restrictive sphere in which Jewish children were allowed to live, the particular difficulties children faced in the Holocaust, and the experience of children in the immediate postwar period. Readings include texts by Ruth Klüger, Harry Mulisch, Imre Kertész, Miriam Katin, David Grossman and others. Course conducted entirely in English. OPEN TO FIRST YEARS. STUDENTS MUST ENROLL IN BOTH MAIN SECTION AND A DISCUSSION SECTION. Note: course will not count towards German major or minor.",

One of the main purposes of the course is to investigate the phenomenon of majority/minority relations, to examine the ways in which the Jewish community interacted with and experienced European societies, cultures, and politics. We will look at the dynamics of boundary formation and cultural distinctiveness; the limits of religious and social tolerance; the periodic eruption of persecution in its social, political, and religious contexts; and the prospects for Jewish integration into various European societies during the course of the Enlightenment era.",

The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

        "Course Description": "Among the many profound changes that have occurred in the Muslim World since the nineteenth century, one of the most transformative is that which academics popularly term the \"crisis of religious authority.\" According to the academic narrative, as modern nation states emerged in the nineteenth century they created vast bureaucracies, universal compulsory education systems, new judicial structures, and other institutions. One of the key consequences of these changes was the marginalization of the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, who up until that time had enjoyed almost unparalleled authority to define Islamic social norms for the masses, dispense justice through the courts, educate the elites, and so on. Mass education, increased access to Islamic texts, and new technologies of disruption such as the internet have allowed new actors ranging from fundamentalists to feminists to emerge and challenge the Muslim scholarly elite's monopoly on the authoritative interpretation of Islam. Today, the so-called crisis of religious authority in Islam is cited as a cause for all manner of developments ranging from terrorism to increased gender equality. However, there has never been an institutionalized clerical hierarchy in Islam, and religious authority is not simply 'had' or claimed in a straightforward manner. Instead, in different times and places different actors have reworked traditional modes of claiming authority and taken advantage of new technologies to promote their own interpretations of Islamic texts and norms as authoritative while challenging the claims of others. Our approach to exploring religious authority in Islam and its modern crisis will be both thematic and chronological. We will consider how the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, have historically laid claim to be the authoritative voices of Islam, and how they have responded to new challenges. We will then consider how the modern state and new developments have produced new actors who have sought to promulgate their own authoritative claims about Islamic texts and practices. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of the different modes of argumentation and techniques used by a range of actors to claim Islamic authority. They will acquire the skills to critically analyze how competing arguments are constructed in relation to modern debates and issues such as the rise of ISIS and new developments in Islamic Feminism. We will conclude by considering why established religious authority and its dissolution is so often considered both the cause of, and solution to, so many of the social ills in the Muslim World.",

        "Course Description": "The return of White nationalism and misogyny to the public sphere since the 2016 election has reinvigorated the trope of the subjugated Muslim woman as backwards and subservient to her male counterparts. Rather than devote our time to dispel stereotypes, in this course, we address the extent to which Western theories of feminism are useful to account for Muslim women's experiences across historical period and geographical region. By examining discourses of gender, sexuality, the ideals of the feminine and masculine in Islamic scriptures and jurisprudence, and\nsubsequent encounters with Western imperialism, we investigate how gender informs social, political, religious, and family life in Islamic cultures. We employ a chronological approach to these topics, beginning with the status of women in seventh century Arabia, to the period of Islamic expansion across Asia, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the colonial period ending with the contemporary post 9/11 and post 2016 US contexts, wherein debates over the status of Muslim women in society emerge with renewed vigor. \n",

        "Course Description": "This course explores the history and culture of the Sephardic diaspora from the expulsion of Spanish and Portuguese Jewry at the end of the fifteenth century to the present. We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today. Note: FIrst year students are welcome to enroll in this course.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines slavery and its abolition in the Middle East and North Africa from 600 C.E. to the 20th Century. It addresses slavery as a discourse and a question of political economy. We begin with an overview of slavery in late antiquity to contextualize the evolution of this practice after the rise of Islam in the region. We then examine how it was practiced, imagined, and studied under major empires, such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and the Safavids. In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of \"slave dynasties\" following a chronological order. We discuss, through primary sources, theoretical, religious, and moral debates and positions on slavery, including religious scriptures, prophetic traditions, religious law, and a plethora of narratives from a range of genres. We highlight a distinct theme each week to focus on until we conclude our discussion with the abolition of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics of discussion include various forms of male and female slavery, Qur'anic and prophetic discourse on slavery, legal and moral views on slavery, slavery as represented in religious literature, political, military, and economic structures of slavery, issues of race and gender as well as slave writings to reflect on the experiences of slavery from within. The goal is to enable students to understand the histories of slavery in the Middle East and eventually compare it to that of other regions and cultures, such as European and Atlantic slavery.

        "Course Description": "Although today primarily associated with oil, the Arabian peninsula was for most of its history defined by water: its surrounding seas, its monsoon-driven winds, and its lack of water in its vast and forbidding interior deserts. As home to the major holy cities of Islam and a key source of global oil, the region has played an important role in the Western European and North American imagination. Despite being relatively sparsely populated, the peninsula hosts millions of believers each year on the annual Muslim pilgrimage and has been the site of major wars and military occupations by European, American, and other Middle Eastern countries for much of the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries: an outpost of the Ottoman Empire, center of British colonialism and (at Aden) an axis of its global empire, location of Egypt's \"Vietnam\" (its long war in Yemen in the 1960s), the Gulf Wars I and II, the recent wars in Yemen, to name just a few of the major conflicts. Often depicted as unchanging until caught up by the influx of massive oil wealth, this region is frequently characterized as a place of contradictions: home to some of\nthe world's largest skyscrapers and also the most inhospitable and largest sand desert in the world, known as \"the Empty Quarter\"; the location of crucial American allies and the home of al-Qa'eda founder `Usama Bin Laden. In this course, we will examine the development of the peninsula historically to understand these contradictory images. We will investigate changes in the following arenas: environment and society; colonial occupation; newly independent states;\nthe demise and development of key economic sectors (pearling, shipping; agriculture; oil; finance; piracy); political regimes; resources such as water, oil, date palms; the growth of oil extraction infrastructure and its effects on the political regimes and societies in the region; the emergence of new Gulf cities; Islamic law; women's rights; human rights debates; religious and ethnic minorities.",

Current issues in Israel's foreign policy are then discussed, including the Iranian nuclear deal, the formation of an Israeli-Sunni alliance, the BDS movement, terrorism, and prospects for a future Palestinian state. Students are tasked with applying theories of international relations to the Israeli case and examining their explanatory and predictive powers.

        "Course Description": "Tensions between center and periphery; migration and rest; power and powerlessness; exile, home, and return are easily found in the historical record of both Jews and Muslims. For Muslims, it can be said that it was the very success of Islam as a world culture, and the establishment of Muslim societies in in all corners of the globe, that lay at the root of this unease.  But the disruptions of the post-colonial era, the emergence of minority Muslim communities in Europe and North America, and the recent, tragic flow of refugees following the Arab Spring have created a heightened sense of displacement and yearning for many.  \n \nOf course, the very term \"diaspora\"-from ancient Greek, meaning dispersion or scattering-has most often been used to describe the Jewish condition in the world. The themes of exile and return, catastrophe and redemption, are already woven into the Hebrew Bible and continued to be central motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity and the middle ages.  This, despite the fact that more Jews lived outside the borders of Judea than within the country many years before the destruction of Jewish sovereignty at the hands of the Romans. In the twentieth century, European imperialism, nationalisms of various types, revolution, and war-including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict-have done much to underscore the continuing dilemmas of Diaspora and home in both Jewish and Islamic identity.  \n \nThe goal of this course is to offer a comparative, historical perspective on the themes of migration and displacement, center and periphery, home and residence, exile and return, and to give students the opportunity to examine in depth some aspect of the experience of \"Diaspora\".\n\nNote: This course fulfills the capstone requirement for Jewish, Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. The course also counts as an Advanced Seminar for History. (Students wishing to receive History Advanced Seminar credit should also enroll in L22 491R section 19 for 1 unit.)

Taking the above questions as a starting point, this course aims at a systematic and historically contextualized analysis of a broad range of Jewish texts that are commonly classified as \"mystical\". (All primary texts are read in translation.) At the same time, we explore such overarching themes as: the interplay of esoteric exegesis of the Bible and visionary experiences; the place of traditional Jewish law (halakhah) within mystical thought and practice; the role of gender, sexuality, and the body in Jewish mystical speculation and prayer; the relationship between mysticism and messianism; Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions and their mutual impact on Jewish mysticism; the \"absence of women\" from Jewish mystical movements; esoteric traditions of an elite vs. mysticism as a communal endeavor; and the tension between innovation and (the claim to) tradition in the history of Jewish mysticism.",

Topics include dialogues between the German and Jewish Enlightenments, Salon culture and the development of meaningful contacts between Germans and Jews, the intersections of aesthetic discourse and antisemitism, the rise of Yiddish theater and the visual and acoustic language of the Jewish Renaissance. Moving beyond narratives of assimilation or acculturation, we will discuss the complex and shifting nature of German-Jewish subjectivities and investigate the entanglements of German, Austrian and Jewish culture through frameworks of difference, indifference, performance, and cultural transfer.

One of the main purposes of the course is to investigate the phenomenon of majority/minority relations, to examine the ways in which the Jewish community interacted with and experienced European societies, cultures, and politics. We will look at the dynamics of boundary formation and cultural distinctiveness; the limits of religious and social tolerance; the periodic eruption of persecution in its social, political, and religious contexts; and the prospects for Jewish integration into various European societies during the course of the Enlightenment era.",

The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

        "Course Description": "Among the many profound changes that have occurred in the Muslim World since the nineteenth century, one of the most transformative is that which academics popularly term the \"crisis of religious authority.\" According to the academic narrative, as modern nation states emerged in the nineteenth century they created vast bureaucracies, universal compulsory education systems, new judicial structures, and other institutions. One of the key consequences of these changes was the marginalization of the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, who up until that time had enjoyed almost unparalleled authority to define Islamic social norms for the masses, dispense justice through the courts, educate the elites, and so on. Mass education, increased access to Islamic texts, and new technologies of disruption such as the internet have allowed new actors ranging from fundamentalists to feminists to emerge and challenge the Muslim scholarly elite's monopoly on the authoritative interpretation of Islam. Today, the so-called crisis of religious authority in Islam is cited as a cause for all manner of developments ranging from terrorism to increased gender equality. However, there has never been an institutionalized clerical hierarchy in Islam, and religious authority is not simply 'had' or claimed in a straightforward manner. Instead, in different times and places different actors have reworked traditional modes of claiming authority and taken advantage of new technologies to promote their own interpretations of Islamic texts and norms as authoritative while challenging the claims of others. Our approach to exploring religious authority in Islam and its modern crisis will be both thematic and chronological. We will consider how the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, have historically laid claim to be the authoritative voices of Islam, and how they have responded to new challenges. We will then consider how the modern state and new developments have produced new actors who have sought to promulgate their own authoritative claims about Islamic texts and practices. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of the different modes of argumentation and techniques used by a range of actors to claim Islamic authority. They will acquire the skills to critically analyze how competing arguments are constructed in relation to modern debates and issues such as the rise of ISIS and new developments in Islamic Feminism. We will conclude by considering why established religious authority and its dissolution is so often considered both the cause of, and solution to, so many of the social ills in the Muslim World.",

        "Course Description": "This course explores the history and culture of the Sephardic diaspora from the expulsion of Spanish and Portuguese Jewry at the end of the fifteenth century to the present. We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today. Note: FIrst year students are welcome to enroll in this course.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines slavery and its abolition in the Middle East and North Africa from 600 C.E. to the 20th Century. It addresses slavery as a discourse and a question of political economy. We begin with an overview of slavery in late antiquity to contextualize the evolution of this practice after the rise of Islam in the region. We then examine how it was practiced, imagined, and studied under major empires, such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and the Safavids. In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of \"slave dynasties\" following a chronological order. We discuss, through primary sources, theoretical, religious, and moral debates and positions on slavery, including religious scriptures, prophetic traditions, religious law, and a plethora of narratives from a range of genres. We highlight a distinct theme each week to focus on until we conclude our discussion with the abolition of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics of discussion include various forms of male and female slavery, Qur'anic and prophetic discourse on slavery, legal and moral views on slavery, slavery as represented in religious literature, political, military, and economic structures of slavery, issues of race and gender as well as slave writings to reflect on the experiences of slavery from within. The goal is to enable students to understand the histories of slavery in the Middle East and eventually compare it to that of other regions and cultures, such as European and Atlantic slavery. No second language required.",

        "Course Description": "Although today primarily associated with oil, the Arabian peninsula was for most of its history defined by water: its surrounding seas, its monsoon-driven winds, and its lack of water in its vast and forbidding interior deserts. As home to the major holy cities of Islam and a key source of global oil, the region has played an important role in the Western European and North American imagination. Despite being relatively sparsely populated, the peninsula hosts millions of believers each year on the annual Muslim pilgrimage and has been the site of major wars and military occupations by European, American, and other Middle Eastern countries for much of the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries: an outpost of the Ottoman Empire, center of British colonialism and (at Aden) an axis of its global empire, location of Egypt's \"Vietnam\" (its long war in Yemen in the 1960s), the Gulf Wars I and II, the recent wars in Yemen, to name just a few of the major conflicts. Often depicted as unchanging until caught up by the influx of massive oil wealth, this region is frequently characterized as a place of contradictions: home to some of\nthe world's largest skyscrapers and also the most inhospitable and largest sand desert in the world, known as \"the Empty Quarter\"; the location of crucial American allies and the home of al-Qa'eda founder `Usama Bin Laden. In this course, we will examine the development of the peninsula historically to understand these contradictory images. We will investigate changes in the following arenas: environment and society; colonial occupation; newly independent states;\nthe demise and development of key economic sectors (pearling, shipping; agriculture; oil; finance; piracy); political regimes; resources such as water, oil, date palms; the growth of oil extraction infrastructure and its effects on the political regimes and societies in the region; the emergence of new Gulf cities; Islamic law; women's rights; human rights debates; religious and ethnic minorities.",

The course reviews the evolution of Israel's foreign policy towards various actors in the international arena, including the United States, the European Union, Russia, Germany, the United Nations, and the Jewish Diaspora (with a special focus on the Jewish community in the US). The course then focuses on the Israeli-Arab conflict, stages in its development, approaches to its settlement, and its effect on Israel's foreign relations with Arab and Muslim states. Current issues in Israel's foreign policy are then discussed, including the Iranian nuclear deal, the formation of an Israeli-Sunni alliance, the BDS movement, terrorism, and prospects for a future Palestinian state. Students are tasked with applying theories of international relations to the Israeli case and examining their explanatory and predictive powers. They will also take part in a class simulation that recreates a major turning point in Israel's foreign relations. Grades are based on two short paper submissions, participation in a simulation, and a final examination.",

        "Course Description": "This undergraduate course surveys the major writers and works of 20th century Korean literature.  During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization.  From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation.  By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultural production.  In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation.  How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self?  And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?  Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature.  This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.  All literary texts are in English translation and no previous knowledge of Korean is required.",

Beginning with the earliest human occupations in the region more than 12,000 years ago, this course examines how domestication, urbanization, the rise of early states, and major technological inventions changed life in the Andes from small village societies to the largest territorial polity of the Americas - the Inca Empire. Students will become familiar with the major debates in the field of Andean archaeology. Together, we will examine archaeological evidence (architecture, art, ceramics, metals, textiles, plant and animal remains, etc.) from context of everyday life (households, food production, craft production) to the rituals and ceremonies (offerings, tombs) that took place in domestic and public spaces. We will also touch on the role of Andean archaeology in the context of national politics and heritage sustainability.",

It registered four \"great revolutions\": Mexico 1910, Bolivia 1952, Cuba 1959, and Nicaragua 1979. These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted. With the exception perhaps of the Bolivian Revolution, these revolutions had a profound impact on Latin American and world politics. The primary aim of this course is to analyze and compare the causes, processes, and outcomes of the Mexican, Cuban, and Nicaraguan revolutions.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines the Epigrams of Martial and the Satires of Juvenal in their context (Rome and the Roman world of the 80s-120s CE). Near- contemporaries and acquaintances, these two poets have had a massive impact on modern perceptions of the state of Rome under Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian. The world they represent is actually as much a poetic world full of dramas and fictions as it is a real place. From our readings the poets and from sources on their work and times, we will gain an understanding of their literary agendas. Topics of discussion and research will include imperial politics, the poetic career and literary tradition, Roman public spaces, amicitia and its rituals, private life, and sexual behavior. We will relentlessly practice accurate and clear Latin translation and scansion of the meters used by the epigrammatist and satirist, and every student will conduct and present original research.

Further, this course should enable you to consider law as a future area of study and career. Interested students may continue their study in the spring semester with an optional one-credit seminar focusing on contemporary Supreme Court cases.

The subject of this inquiry will be the Nuremberg trials - the innovations and critiques around the law and politics of the trials themselves, as well as the trials' legacies for ideas about international justice in postwar America and the world. Course requirements include a 15 page research paper and a series of short reaction papers to the assigned readings. Course is for first-year, non-transfer students only.",

However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.

        "Course Description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from any academic discipline (and with any post-graduate plans) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding the conduct, mode of analysis and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the extent of a landlord's (or university's) duty to prevent criminal assaults on its tenants (students), groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, the use and abuse of class action lawsuits, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. Prerequisite: sophomore standing or higher. It is most definitely not a prerequisite to be intending or even thinking about going to law school.\nNo more than two excused absences during the semester.",

        "Course Description": "This course (formerly called \"Women and the Law\") explores how social constructions of gender, race, class, and sexuality have shaped traditional legal reasoning and American legal concepts, including women's legal rights.  We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty.

        "Course Description": "\"Go get yourself some democracy!\" Americans have so often preached to other nations.  But just how did Americans themselves go about creating the world's largest and most successful democratic republic?   And how democratic was this violent new nation that reeled from one crisis to another, and ultimately to the brink of collapse in its first seventy-five years?  This survey of American history from the creation of the Republic to the eve of the Civil War explores the Revolution and its ambiguous legacies, the starkly paradoxical \"marriage\" of slavery and freedom, and the creation of much of the America that we know; mass political parties; a powerful Presidency; sustained capitalist growth; individualistic creeds; formalized and folkloric racism; heteronormative patriarchal family life; technological innovation; literary experimentation; distinctively American legal, scientific and religious cultures; and the modern movements of labor, feminism, and African-American empowerment.

To uncover how different feminist theories have been adopted in the struggle for political transformation and social justice, we will pursue two main lines of inquiry. The first asks how feminist thinkers from various traditions critique and engage the history of political thought within the social contract\ntradition. We will ask, in particular, how gender, race, slavery, colonialism and empire shape conceptions of citizenship and property. We will also examine transnational feminist critiques of the public/private division in the Western political theory canon as it impacts the role of women and the social construction of women's bodies. During the second half of the semester, we will ask how various transnational social movements have engaged and adopted feminist theories in efforts to resist state violence, colonialism, labor exploitation and resource extraction. In following\nthese lines of inquiry we will draw from postcolonial, decolonial, liberal, Black, radical, Marxist and Chicana feminist perspectives. Part of our goal will be to uncover how various feminist theories treat the relationship between politics and embodied experience, how gendered conceptions of family life affect notions of political power and how ideas about sexuality and sexual conquest intersect with empire-building.

Why is it hard to sound romantic while speaking Klingon? What are the benefits of Lojban's attempt to rid the world of confusion and ambiguity?  This course explores the design of and motivation for constructed languages from a modern linguistic point of view. Constructed languages are those that are the result of some conscious and deliberate design rather than ones occurring naturally. We will explore the different motivations for  language construction, from the desire to create a \"perfect language\", to fictional world building, to fostering global harmony. In characterizing the different types of invented languages, students will develop familiarity with the basic tools of linguistic theory, focusing on phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Languages analyzed in detail include Klingon, Esperanto, Heptapod B, Lojban, Dothraki, Valyrian, Elvish, and various philosophical languages.  This class is only open to first-year students.",

Students who complete both semesters will have completed the material Calc III and other topics that may let them move through the upper level math curriculum more quickly.  Sets, functions, real numbers, and methods of proof. The Riemann-Darboux integral, limits and continuity, differentiation, and the fundamental theorems of calculus. Sequences and series of real numbers and of functions. Vector spaces and linear maps.  Prerequisite: Score of 5 on the A.P Calculus Exam, BC version, or the equivalent.\n\n",

Topics include statistical summaries and graphical presentations of data, discrete and continuous random variables, the logic of statistical inference, design of research studies, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. Students will learn a critical approach to reading statistical analyses reported in the media, and how to correctly interpret the outputs of common statistical routines for fitting models to data and testing hypotheses. A major objective of the course is to gain familiarity with basic R commands to implement common data analysis procedures. Students intending to pursue a major or minor in mathematics or wishing to take 400 level or above statistics courses should instead take Math 3200.\nEXAMINATION SCHEDULE:  Tests, at which attendance is required, will be given from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on September 16, October 21, and November 18. \nPrereqs: Math 131",

        "Course Description": "Philosophy of medicine is an investigation into what doctors know, and how they know it.  This course will investigate the following questions:  What is disease?  What is health?  How do we classify disease?  What counts as good evidence and good evidential reasoning in medicine?  Is medicine a science?  If so, what makes it distinctive as a science?  What kinds of evidential roles do case studies play in medicine?  How ought we to measure and compare outcomes in clinical trials and in systematic reviews?  What is the appropriate relationship between medicine and the basic sciences, or, medicine and the public health sciences (e.g., epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, and behavioral science)?  What role, if any, ought private industry - such as the pharmaceutical industry, or health insurance industry - play in shaping the practice of medicine?  How ought we to define and measure \"effectiveness\" in medicine?  Do values inform decision making about health policy, and if so, how?  The overall goal of the course is to develop a reasoned, reflective approach to research and practice in medicine, through critical analysis of texts, and case studies in the history of medicine.  You do not need a major in philosophy or background in philosophy to take this course.  This course is intended to be of special interest to pre-health professionals, or philosophy or science majors. For graduate students in philosophy, this course satisfies the seminar requirement.  Extra assignments will be provided to satisfy graduate coursework; please see me for details.",

Patients have been writing not only about what it feels like to be ill, but also about the ways doctors have both helped and failed them. We will read a sample of these works by physicians, patients, and journalists, drawing from a list that includes Gawande, Sacks, Ofri, Chen, Selzer, Kalanithi, Groopman, Mukherjee, Sweet, Elliott, Jamison, Ehrenreich, Sontag, Hillenbrand, O'Rourke, Trillin, Mairs, Hemon, Specter, Tisdale, Keefe, and Khatchadourian. In this writing-centered class, we will focus on how, why, and how well physicians and patients make written arguments to the public. Writing assignments will allow students to work on the matter of how best to represent illness, and to improve their skills in analysis and argumentation. Peer review sessions will encourage substantive revision. This course does not count toward the Creative Writing Concentration, but creative writers are most welcome.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines diverse American popular music styles and genres in their historical and socio-political contexts. Following a rough chronology, the course centers African American musicians as creators and innovators of a vast range of music forms that make up the foundations of contemporary popular music in the United States and across the globe. We will consider the following questions: Does popular music in America merely entertain us, or does the music we listen to do something more and touch upon issues in our lives? Can it do both simultaneously? Can popular artists influence politics, or is that too much to ask of them?In order to address these and other questions, we will interrogate how musicians, performers, scholars, listeners, and consumers experience, participate in and think about various music and dance practices, from slave music and minstrelsy, the blues, jazz, and rock and roll to reggae and hip hop. Historically and through the present, we will consider how African American musicians, as well as musicians and performers from other underrepresented groups, have so often been excluded from reaping the economic and political benefits of music industries, and how they have contested injustice on multiple levels. This means that our core questions ask what musical practices can reveal about relations of race, gender, class and belonging in this country. Readings are drawn from the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music studies, and dance studies. Prerequisite: Music 121 or permission of instructor.\n",

In our study, music is situated as part of a web of metapatterns which explain the structure and nature of musical materials, the actions in composition and improvisation and musical phenomena. Students are placed on a listener's journey of discovery to find the nature of music through philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, biology, architecture and the structure of sound itself. Music theory topics both simple and advanced are discussed in ways appropriate for the novice as well as the advanced student. The course functions as a music theory and music literature study through the lens of the humanities.\n\nThe course embraces both culture and nature, seeking out the grand-scale patterns that help explain the qualities of our musical endeavor. The course begins with the archetypal patterns of space, both structural/formal and relational, then turning to the concepts that infuse the workings of time - a virtual sonic reality of space and time, the mind of music, revealed in thought provoking and new contexts. \n",

Students will analyze the various methodologies and types of \"fieldwork\" that scholars from across disciplines use to discuss the voice in music, including archival, ethnographic, and cultural studies approaches to research. We will investigate the voice's role in diverse forms of individual and group singing, how voice relates to technology and media, and how the diva archetype becomes applied to singers and vocal genres. A wide range of academic literature, media texts, and listening examples will be used to develop interdisciplinary and intersectional analyses of voice. Musical training is not required, but students will engage with musical sounds and content in class discussions and assignments and learn about how voices produce sound in different vocal traditions.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines theories of the body, embodiment and the senses, as they relate to music and sound practices. Readings draw on scholarship from ethnomusicology, anthropology and geography of the senses, sound studies, dance studies, performance studies, and music cognition. If ethnomusicology is \"the study of people making music,\" this course explores how people make and experience music and sound with their bodies, through the full range of their senses. We will ask questions such as: How do musicians, audiences, listeners and dancers perceive and experience music in their bodies and contribute to making sound? Centering the body, we will necessarily consider lived experience along intersecting axes of difference such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and (dis)ability. Course readings and discussions will therefore focus on the social and political affordances and limitations of body-based practices and their theorization. \n\nCase studies include a broad range of sound-movement practices from electronic dance music and black social dance to Sufi and Buddhist religious practices, queer taiko drumming to Deaf music-making. Over the course of the semester, students will develop their own project exploring course themes, and they will be asked to participate in music-movement workshops throughout the course. This is an upper-level/graduate-level course, so some knowledge of music and/or dance concepts is assumed, but neither previous music/dance experience nor normative bodily ability are required. \n",

What is health?  How do we classify disease?  What counts as good evidence and good evidential reasoning in medicine?  Is medicine a science?  If so, what makes it distinctive as a science?  What kinds of evidential roles do case studies play in medicine?  How ought we to measure and compare outcomes in clinical trials and in systematic reviews?  What is the appropriate relationship between medicine and the basic sciences, or, medicine and the public health sciences (e.g., epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, and behavioral science)?  What role, if any, ought private industry - such as the pharmaceutical industry, or health insurance industry - play in shaping the practice of medicine?  How ought we to define and measure \"effectiveness\" in medicine?  Do values inform decision making about health policy, and if so, how?  The overall goal of the course is to develop a reasoned, reflective approach to research and practice in medicine, through critical analysis of texts, and case studies in the history of medicine.  You do not need a major in philosophy or background in philosophy to take this course.  This course is intended to be of special interest to pre-health professionals, or philosophy or science majors.

In our study, music is situated as part of a web of metapatterns which explain the structure and nature of musical materials, the actions in composition and improvisation and musical phenomena. Students are placed on a listener's journey of discovery to find the nature of music through philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, biology, architecture and the structure of sound itself. Music theory topics both simple and advanced are discussed in ways appropriate for the novice as well as the advanced student. The course functions as a music theory and music literature study through the lens of the humanities.\n\nThe course embraces both culture and nature, seeking out the grand-scale patterns that help explain the qualities of our musical endeavor. The course begins with the archetypal patterns of space, both structural/formal and relational, then turning to the concepts that infuse the workings of time - a virtual sonic reality of space and time, the mind of music, revealed in thought provoking and new contexts. \n",

        "Course Description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from any academic discipline (and with any post-graduate plans) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding the conduct, mode of analysis and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the extent of a landlord's (or university's) duty to prevent criminal assaults on its tenants (students), groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, the use and abuse of class action lawsuits, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. Prerequisite: sophomore standing or higher. It is most definitely not a prerequisite to be intending or even thinking about going to law school.\nNo more than two excused absences during the semester.",

The production, perception, and understanding of art are human capacities that can shed light on the workings of the mind and brain. This course considers questions such as: What is aesthetic experience? How do pictures represent? Does art express emotion? Can we learn from fiction? What is artistic expertise, and how do we cultivate it?  Prerequisites: one course in Philosophy at the 100 or 200-level, or permission of the instructor.

Has it fundamentally altered the social context in which such arguments will be received? We will think about what computers are, what minds are, and how these two things are related. We will explore approaches from good old fashioned symbol processing to connectionism, networks, robotics, and contagion models. Philosophically, we will focus mostly on the problem of intentionality and on whether it's possible for computational machines to understand what they are doing.",

How do our thoughts represent the external world? We will then move onto considering how minds work. How much of our knowledge is innate, and how much do we learn from experience? Does our language constrain our thoughts? Can non-linguistic animals think? How do the different sensory modalities interact with each other?

This interest has roots in tradition: historically, art, aesthetics, and vision science have often been linked. But the growth of knowledge in cognitive science has opened up new opportunities for understanding art and addressing philosophical questions. The converse is also true. The production, perception, and understanding of art are human capacities that can shed light on the workings of the mind and brain. This course considers questions such as: What is aesthetic experience? How do pictures represent? Does art express emotion? Can we learn from fiction? What is artistic expertise, and how do we cultivate it?  Prerequisites: one course in Philosophy at the 100 or 200-level, or permission of the instructor.

Has it fundamentally altered the social context in which such arguments will be received? We will think about what computers are, what minds are, and how these two things are related. We will explore approaches from good old fashioned symbol processing to connectionism, networks, robotics, and contagion models. Philosophically, we will focus mostly on the problem of intentionality and on whether it's possible for computational machines to understand what they are doing.",

Questions to be examined include: Are perceptual representations structured differently from thoughts? Does perception deploy concepts? Is perception modular? Does perception represent \"rich\" properties like being a tiger, or only \"sparse\" properties like shape, color, and motion? What tools can we use to single out perceptual representations experimentally? How do we go from perceptually representing the environment to forming beliefs about it? How does perception get transformed into action? How are our perceptual and cognitive capacities similar to and different from those of non-human animals? How do low-level cognitive capacities work? Can thoughts be maplike? Do our automatic cognitive biases work in a perception-like fashion? \n\nPrerequisites:  PNP major standing with a 300-level course in philosophy or PNP, graduate standing or the permission of the instructor.",

In order to understand both classical astronomy and the results obtained from modern telescopes and the space program, basic scientific ideas are reviewed first. There will also some discussion of astronomical history  to show how we have arrived at our present ideas of the structure and evolution of the solar system. Although the course addresses primarily non-science majors, also science majors can use it as a general introduction to modern astrophysics. The course will be fully remote with two synchronous class meetings per week. There will be no final exam. Seats have been added to the course capacity. Interested students can continue to add themselves to the wait list. Freshmen-year students are specially encouraged to enroll.

        "Course Description": "Astrophysics is the study of the planets, the Sun and other stars, the Milky Way Galaxy and the other galaxies, the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium, and the Universe itself.  This study is aided by our knowledge of the laws of Physics discovered by experiments carried out in laboratories.  Occasionally the astronomical observations reveal new fundamental laws of Physics.  For example the observations of motions of the planets helped Newton discover the universe square law of gravitation. We begin with the motions of the Sun and the Moon as we see them across the sky, then to the motions of the planets.  We then go on to describe how stars are born, and evolve, until they end up as white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes.  During this evolution, elements like C, N, O, etc. all the way to U were synthesized and dispersed across the Galaxy by stellar winds and supernova explosions.  We will also discuss fascinating topics, like, cosmic rays and astronomies with radio, x-ray, gamma-ray and gravitational waves.  In short we will discuss everything that is contained in the universe and the evolution of the universe itself.  The purpose of the course is to kindle your interest in these exotic phenomena and prepare you for their more detailed study.  Knowledge of the Physics described in the introductory course in physics (such as 197 and 198) will be very helpful in readily following the lectures; however a brief summary of the needed background will be provided during the lectures. Prerequisites: Physics 191 and 191L and 192 and 192L or Physics 197 and 198 or permission of instructor. Remote online and asynchronous.Office hours as needed during listed times.

But efficient algorithms, specific software packages, neural nets, etc., are only tools, and are easily misused. In a research setting, working with data is primarily an exercise in critical thinking. The purpose of this interactive, hands-on course is to learn from mistakes by making them in a safe environment. After covering/reviewing probability theory; Bayesian inference; elements of information theory and random matrix theory, the course will focus on case studies of real-world biological data, such as quantitative imaging data, next-generation sequencing (metagenomics), and neural recordings. These modules will involve critical reading of research papers and working through puzzle-based assignments. The primary modules will be supplemented by shorter presentations on topics chosen by students. Fair warning: this is explicitly NOT a course on \"big data\" or machine learning, although students may choose to explore some of these topics in their presentations (required for credit). Prerequisites: Open to undergraduates with prior programming experience and a quantitative background (Phys 197/198, Math 203 or similar; contact instructor if unsure). Course mimics a research environment and undergraduates considering an academic research track especially encouraged. Experience with data or statistics not required. Graduate students will be required to pick a more advanced presentation topic. Format: Fully remote, synchronous twice/week.",

        "Course Description": "Data science\" is most commonly associated with topics in computer science. But efficient algorithms, specific software packages, neural nets, etc., are only tools, and are easily misused. In a research setting, working with data is primarily an exercise in critical thinking. The purpose of this interactive, hands-on course is to learn from mistakes by making them in a safe environment. After covering/reviewing probability theory; Bayesian inference; elements of information theory and random matrix theory, the course will focus on case studies of real-world biological data, such as quantitative imaging data, next-generation sequencing (metagenomics), and neural recordings. These modules will involve critical reading of research papers and working through puzzle-based assignments. The primary modules will be supplemented by shorter presentations on topics chosen by students. Fair warning: this is explicitly NOT a course on \"big data\" or machine learning, although students may choose to explore some of these topics in their presentations (required for credit). Prerequisites: Open to undergraduates with prior programming experience and a quantitative background (Phys 197/198, Math 203 or similar; contact instructor if unsure). Course mimics a research environment and undergraduates considering an academic research track especially encouraged. Experience with data or statistics not required. Graduate students will be required to pick a more advanced presentation topic. Format: Fully remote, synchronous twice/week.",

Campaigns are start-ups that rely on strategy, branding, influencing consumers (voters), financing and other concepts to achieve the elections of their candidate. At the same time, American politics is highly polarized with voters who are increasingly hostile to listening to the other side. Given this context, how does a campaign succeed as an entrepreneurial venture? The course will allow students to compare and contrast how different candidate's policies/platforms may impact different constituencies/sectors of the business/labor world as well as the economy and how the media portrays them and what role they will play in the general election. This course is for first-year (non-transfer) students only. Students who are not first-year students will be automatically unenrolled from this course.",

We cover key theoretical concepts in IR and discuss how empirical evidence and key historical events relate to and inform theory. The course is organized around specific substantive questions such as: why do states choose to fight rather than negotiate?; why are levels of economic development among states so unequal?; how do international institutions affect conflict and cooperation?; what logic is behind the use of terrorism by political actors?; and, why do states experience civil war? Most weeks in the course, we will explore one big topic. Each week, we will generally first read the textbook chapter, which provides a nice overview and references to key pieces of literature. For the second lecture (and precept), we will read two or three important articles on the topic. This way, we will gain background through the textbook and subsequently build upon it with more specialized readings.",

        "Course Description": "This course studies the ways non-state groups use violence in pursuit of political goals. During the semester we will engage with contemporary research on political violence, including civil war, ethnic conflict, terrorism and communal riots. The goal of the course is to introduce students to major questions related to the study of political violence. What explains the onset of violence? Why do individuals choose to join violent movements? Is non-violent protest more effective than the use of violent tactics? During the semester, we will read a large volume of within-country and cross-national quantitative research on political violence and also examine several cases in detail, including ethnic riots in India, Rwandan genocide, and Kurdish conflict in Turkey.",

        "Course Description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from any academic discipline (and with any post-graduate plans) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding the conduct, mode of analysis and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the extent of a landlord's (or university's) duty to prevent criminal assaults on its tenants (students), groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, the use and abuse of class action lawsuits, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. Prerequisite: sophomore standing or higher. It is most definitely not a prerequisite to be intending or even thinking about going to law school.\nNo more than two excused absences during the semester.",

My goal is to expose you to contemporary research on a) how political intolerance is conceptualized and understood, especially within the context of theories of democracy; b) how political intolerance can be measured, both at the level of the individual and the institution/society; c) where intolerance originates, both in terms of individual psychology and system-level politics; and d) what consequences flow from intolerance, especially in terms of legal and extra-legal political repression, as well cultural consequences (e.g., a \"culture of conformity\"). The course makes little distinction between American politics and politics in other parts of the world (although no knowledge of specific non-U.S. systems is required as a prerequisite).",

We will critically examine how psychological factors such as emotions, identity, cognition, and motivation impact (and are impacted by) political violence. We will examine these processes in the context of crisis diplomacy, national security policy, war, post-conflict reconstruction, and more. Specific examples of potential topics include: the global \"War on Terror,\" ongoing intractable conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, diplomatic standoffs between the US and adversaries such as North Korea and Russia, and refugee and migration crises around the globe. By the end of this course, students should have a clear understanding of how political conflict both affects and is affected by human psychology, and the implications this has for addressing a host of political problems and challenges.",

In this course, students learn computational methods for the analysis of new types of data, including networks, text, audio, images, and videos. We begin with mechanistic approaches to supervised and unsupervised learning, then move to statistical inference with probabilistic interpretations, paying particular attention to the use and misuse of these models in the social sciences. In addition to problem sets, students will collect and analyze novel data to be presented in a department poster session at the end of the semester.",

We then transition to the study of collective memory, or how our memories and identities are shaped by the groups to which we belong. The topics will include transmission of memories and identity through narratives; shared historical memories; battles over how the past is to be remembered; and revision of the memories of the past to meet concerns of the present. We also consider how memory is used in political arguments. Enrollment is restricted to 19 first-year students.",

Are such interventions improving the well-being of today's students or might they actually be further encumbering students' psychological health?

As implied by the title, this seminar shall focus on the intersection between social psychology and political science, with emphasis on the processes driving memory, emotion, and attitude.  This course will address many interesting questions that pertain to the dynamics of politics, including but not limited to the outcome of presidential elections.  For example, how might the threat of terrorism affect voters' proclivity to endorse ideologically conservative vs. liberal views?  Is there a basic difference between how conservatives vs. liberals process information?  How do people make decisions about what is \"moral\" vs. \"immoral\" and how might political attitudes play a role in these kinds of judgments?  What are the ways that religious beliefs play a role in driving people's tendency to endorse vs. reject principles of the Christian Right?  Given the timing of this course, the dynamics of the Fall 2020 presidential election will be a major focus.  PREREQ:  Psych 315.",

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the tools, concepts, and techniques for the experimental study of cognition and behavior in humans and nonhuman animals. We will focus on cognitive capacities that are well-developed in humans and can be compared with those of other species, to develop an understanding of how evolution shapes cognition and behavior. Students who complete this course will be able to ask questions and form hypotheses about the computations and algorithms underlying cognition and behavior, and to design experiments that test these hypotheses.

How, why, and by whom were they granted special status as Scripture? What other books were rejected? We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures? Students unfamiliar with these sacred canons will gain a familiarity with their contents and cultural contexts, while those who already know one or more of them will inevitably discover new insights into their inter-relationship and subtle, often startling contents.",

        "Course Description": "The presence of Muslim minorities in the West is increasingly divisive across the US and Europe as political leaders appeal to voters' fear of the 'Other' to promote Islamophobic agendas that reshape immigration and asylum policies and redefine Western identity as Christian. Politicians further exploit the rise of extremist groups like ISIS to justify anti-Muslim rhetoric and critique multiculturalism, claiming that Islam and the West are inherently antithetical. In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century. We also analyze public US debates on the boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.",

        "Course Description": "This course takes morality and the question of \"what's right\" seriously as a lens through which to understand and assess modern American history. \"Morality\" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be \"good,\" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. Yet \"good\" is a contested concept, especially in a diverse, multiracial society. Thus this class examines a) how state and non-state actors, including religious leaders, have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and b) the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. To what degree does calling something moral or immoral articulate or obstruct policy solutions? What do political coalitions oriented around \"values\" accomplish? Is it possible to hew to moral frames and remain inclusive and tolerant? Topics may include marriage, abortion, immigration, alcohol, incarceration, disease, money, and medical care.",

Rather than devote our time to dispel stereotypes, in this course, we address the extent to which Western theories of feminism are useful to account for Muslim women's experiences across historical period and geographical region. By examining discourses of gender, sexuality, the ideals of the feminine and masculine in Islamic scriptures and jurisprudence, and\nsubsequent encounters with Western imperialism, we investigate how gender informs social, political, religious, and family life in Islamic cultures. We employ a chronological approach to these topics, beginning with the status of women in seventh century Arabia, to the period of Islamic expansion across Asia, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the colonial period ending with the contemporary post 9/11 and post 2016 US contexts, wherein debates over the status of Muslim women in society emerge with renewed vigor. \n",

What are the main contours of spiritual seeking in American culture, especially among those who claim no specific religious affiliation?

But what do we actually mean when we use the word? What is a religion? What does it mean to call something a religion, or \"religious\"? And what does it mean to study religion, given the slipperiness of the concept itself?\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the academic study of religion through a consideration of these questions: What is religion, and how can we study it? Do we need an answer to the first question to pursue the second? Why, and toward what ends, might we undertake such study? We will also consider what is at stake in our investigation and inquiry into religion-for the inquirers, for the subjects of inquiry, and for society more broadly-and what kind of lens the study of religion offers us on ourselves, our neighbors, and society, in turn. To these ends, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion and significant work on religions and religious phenomena, toward a better understanding of what \"religion\" might be and how it might be studied today.  No prior knowledge or experience of religion, religions, or anything religious is expected or required. This course is required for Religious Studies majors and minors. 5 seats in each section are reserved for first year students.",

        "Course Description": "In 1095, pope Urban II urged Christian princes to liberate the Holy Land from Muslim rule. Four years later, after enduring great hardships, the knights who had answered Urban's call conquered the city of Jerusalem. This first crusade and its accomplishments not only shaped the way future crusades were conducted, but also the way in which historians have both understood and framed the idea of a \"crusade\" as an armed pilgrimage sanctioned by the papacy to the holy land. However, the language of crusade was also invoked in campaigns against other enemies of Christendom: the long struggle to reconquer Spain from its Muslim rulers, the wars waged against pagan peoples along the Baltic Sea, and campaigns undertaken against Christian heretics and political foes of the papacy. This course aims to explore the idea of \"crusade\" and \"crusading\" over the course of the Middle Ages and raise questions about what these crusading activities meant for the participants, the public, and posterity. We will examine the causes, immediate effects, and long-term consequences of the crusades, and trace the lasting memory of crusading ideology throughout the Middle Ages and beyond.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will understand the major themes and ideas that made up the medieval crusades and how those themes and ideas changed over time. Students will be able to recognize key components that made up a crusade and identify rhetorical trends that constitute a crusading ideology. Through an examination of holy war, pilgrimage, penance, indulgences, and the like, the students will ground themselves in the very issues that historians use to understand the Middle Ages. Finally, they will also acquire some of the basic skills of the historian's craft, learning how to read primary sources critically, use them to frame an argument, and situate that argument in relation to previous scholarship.\n",

How, why, and by whom were they granted special status as Scripture? What other books were rejected? We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures? Students unfamiliar with these sacred canons will gain a familiarity with their contents and cultural contexts, while those who already know one or more of them will inevitably discover new insights into their inter-relationship and subtle, often startling contents.",

        "Course Description": "The presence of Muslim minorities in the West is increasingly divisive across the US and Europe as political leaders appeal to voters' fear of the 'Other' to promote Islamophobic agendas that reshape immigration and asylum policies and redefine Western identity as Christian. Politicians further exploit the rise of extremist groups like ISIS to justify anti-Muslim rhetoric and critique multiculturalism, claiming that Islam and the West are inherently antithetical. In this course we examine the phenomenon of Islamophobia as a form of anti-Muslim racism. We explore how while the post-9/11 context gave way to an increase in incidents of anti-Muslim violence, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia are deeply rooted in state level anti-black racism from the early twentieth century. We also analyze public US debates on the boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of religion.",

        "Course Description": "The ritual act of taking refuge plays an important role throughout various Buddhist traditions. In this class, we will use this idea as a helpful framework to examine Buddhist doctrines, ideas, theories, and practices. We will attempt to understand what role various forms of media and their ritualistic appropriations played in Buddhist responses to the question of \"how can we end human suffering?\" To do so, we will observe four different ways in which practitioners took refuge in the Buddha. In the first section \"Taking Refuge in the Life of the Buddha,\" we will explore how practitioners attempted to emulate aspects of the Buddha's life stories (jataka). In the second section \"Taking Refuge in the Body of the Buddha,\" we will engage in the practice of relic veneration and its relationship to the Buddha's life stories. In the third section \"Taking Refuge in the Words of the Buddha,\" we will delve into the world of powerful scriptures and their ornamentation, production, and veneration. And in the last section \"Taking Refuge in the Realms of the Buddha,\" we will investigate Buddhist sacred geography and various forms of ma??alas. At the end, this course will offer you many different responses to the problem of human suffering that various Buddhist communities had developed. By surveying these distinct responses, we will realize that \"Buddhism\" is a conglomeration of quite rich and diverse practices and ideas, offering a plethora of sometimes concurring solutions to the problem of human suffering. At the same time, however, we will recognize recurrent themes and similar ritualistic appropriations of mixed media cultural objects that obviously transcended national, congregational, and disciplinary boundaries. In that sense, the heuristic framework of taking refuge in the Buddha allows us to see some continuity in the discontinuous development of Buddhist traditions, their material culture, and ritualistic performances.",

        "Course Description": "This course takes morality and the question of \"what's right\" seriously as a lens through which to understand and assess modern American history. \"Morality\" is, of course, a devilishly flexible rhetoric, a language invoked to tell people how to act and how to be good, or, conversely, to criticize and to shame. When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be \"good,\" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors. Yet \"good\" is a contested concept, especially in a diverse, multiracial society. Thus this class examines a) how state and non-state actors, including religious leaders, have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and b) the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state. To what degree does calling something moral or immoral articulate or obstruct policy solutions? What do political coalitions oriented around \"values\" accomplish? Is it possible to hew to moral frames and remain inclusive and tolerant? Topics may include marriage, abortion, immigration, alcohol, incarceration, disease, money, and medical care.",

The cultural, social, and political lives of Jews have undergone major transformations and dislocations over this time-from innovation to revolution, exclusion to integration, calamity to triumphs.  The themes that we will be exploring in depth include the campaigns for and against Jewish \"emancipation;\" acculturation and religious reform; traditionalism and modernism in Eastern Europe; the rise of political and racial antisemitism; mass migration and the formation of American Jewry; varieties of Jewish national politics; Jewish-Gentile relations between the World Wars; the destruction of European Jewry; the emergence of a Jewish nation-state; and Jewish culture and identity since 1945.",

Rather than devote our time to dispel stereotypes, in this course, we address the extent to which Western theories of feminism are useful to account for Muslim women's experiences across historical period and geographical region. By examining discourses of gender, sexuality, the ideals of the feminine and masculine in Islamic scriptures and jurisprudence, and\nsubsequent encounters with Western imperialism, we investigate how gender informs social, political, religious, and family life in Islamic cultures. We employ a chronological approach to these topics, beginning with the status of women in seventh century Arabia, to the period of Islamic expansion across Asia, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the colonial period ending with the contemporary post 9/11 and post 2016 US contexts, wherein debates over the status of Muslim women in society emerge with renewed vigor. \n",

        "Course Description": "Among the many profound changes that have occurred in the Muslim World since the nineteenth century, one of the most transformative is that which academics popularly term the \"crisis of religious authority.\" According to the academic narrative, as modern nation states emerged in the nineteenth century they created vast bureaucracies, universal compulsory education systems, new judicial structures, and other institutions. One of the key consequences of these changes was the marginalization of the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, who up until that time had enjoyed almost unparalleled authority to define Islamic social norms for the masses, dispense justice through the courts, educate the elites, and so on. Mass education, increased access to Islamic texts, and new technologies of disruption such as the internet have allowed new actors ranging from fundamentalists to feminists to emerge and challenge the Muslim scholarly elite's monopoly on the authoritative interpretation of Islam. Today, the so-called crisis of religious authority in Islam is cited as a cause for all manner of developments ranging from terrorism to increased gender equality. However, there has never been an institutionalized clerical hierarchy in Islam, and religious authority is not simply 'had' or claimed in a straightforward manner. Instead, in different times and places different actors have reworked traditional modes of claiming authority and taken advantage of new technologies to promote their own interpretations of Islamic texts and norms as authoritative while challenging the claims of others. Our approach to exploring religious authority in Islam and its modern crisis will be both thematic and chronological. We will consider how the Muslim scholarly elite, the ulama, have historically laid claim to be the authoritative voices of Islam, and how they have responded to new challenges. We will then consider how the modern state and new developments have produced new actors who have sought to promulgate their own authoritative claims about Islamic texts and practices. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of the different modes of argumentation and techniques used by a range of actors to claim Islamic authority. They will acquire the skills to critically analyze how competing arguments are constructed in relation to modern debates and issues such as the rise of ISIS and new developments in Islamic Feminism. We will conclude by considering why established religious authority and its dissolution is so often considered both the cause of, and solution to, so many of the social ills in the Muslim World.",

        "Course Description": "This course explores the history and culture of the Sephardic diaspora from the expulsion of Spanish and Portuguese Jewry at the end of the fifteenth century to the present. We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today. Note: FIrst year students are welcome to enroll in this course.",

        "Course Description": "This course examines slavery and its abolition in the Middle East and North Africa from 600 C.E. to the 20th Century. It addresses slavery as a discourse and a question of political economy. We begin with an overview of slavery in late antiquity to contextualize the evolution of this practice after the rise of Islam in the region. We then examine how it was practiced, imagined, and studied under major empires, such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and the Safavids. In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of \"slave dynasties\" following a chronological order. We discuss, through primary sources, theoretical, religious, and moral debates and positions on slavery, including religious scriptures, prophetic traditions, religious law, and a plethora of narratives from a range of genres. We highlight a distinct theme each week to focus on until we conclude our discussion with the abolition of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics of discussion include various forms of male and female slavery, Qur'anic and prophetic discourse on slavery, legal and moral views on slavery, slavery as represented in religious literature, political, military, and economic structures of slavery, issues of race and gender as well as slave writings to reflect on the experiences of slavery from within. The goal is to enable students to understand the histories of slavery in the Middle East and eventually compare it to that of other regions and cultures, such as European and Atlantic slavery. No second language required.",

Yet for most individuals living in the ancient Mediterranean, including philosophers, businessmen, and politicians, magic was a part of everyday life. Casting spells, fashioning voodoo dolls, wearing amulets, ingesting potions, and reading the stars are just some of the activities performed by individuals at every level of society. This course examines Greco-Roman, early Christian, and Judaic \"magical\" practices. Students read spell-books which teach how to read the stars, make people fall in love, bring harm to enemies, lock up success in business, and win fame and the respect of peers. Students also look at what is said, both in antiquity and in contemporary scholarship, about magic and the people who practiced it, which helps illuminate the fascinating relationship between magic, medicine, and religion.",

The first section is dedicated to the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which defined the high medieval church as an all-encompassing papal monarchy with broad powers over the lives of all Europeans, Christian and non-Christian alike. In the second section we turn our attention to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which responded to the threat posed by the Protestant Reformation by reforming the Catholic church, tightening ecclesiastical discipline, improving clerical education, and defining and defending Catholic doctrine. We conclude with a consideration of the largest church council ever, Vatican II (1962-1965), which reformed the liturgy and redefined the church to meet the challenges of the modern, multicultural, post-colonial world.",

        "Course Description": "Tensions between center and periphery; migration and rest; power and powerlessness; exile, home, and return are easily found in the historical record of both Jews and Muslims. For Muslims, it can be said that it was the very success of Islam as a world culture, and the establishment of Muslim societies in in all corners of the globe, that lay at the root of this unease.  But the disruptions of the post-colonial era, the emergence of minority Muslim communities in Europe and North America, and the recent, tragic flow of refugees following the Arab Spring have created a heightened sense of displacement and yearning for many.  \n \nOf course, the very term \"diaspora\"-from ancient Greek, meaning dispersion or scattering-has most often been used to describe the Jewish condition in the world. The themes of exile and return, catastrophe and redemption, are already woven into the Hebrew Bible and continued to be central motifs in Rabbinic Judaism in late antiquity and the middle ages.  This, despite the fact that more Jews lived outside the borders of Judea than within the country many years before the destruction of Jewish sovereignty at the hands of the Romans. In the twentieth century, European imperialism, nationalisms of various types, revolution, and war-including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict-have done much to underscore the continuing dilemmas of Diaspora and home in both Jewish and Islamic identity.  \n \nThe goal of this course is to offer a comparative, historical perspective on the themes of migration and displacement, center and periphery, home and residence, exile and return, and to give students the opportunity to examine in depth some aspect of the experience of \"Diaspora\".\n\nNote: This course fulfills the capstone requirement for Jewish, Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. The course also counts as an Advanced Seminar for History. (Students wishing to receive History Advanced Seminar credit should also enroll in L22 491R section 19 for 1 unit.)

In this course we do close readings of some of the greatest Russian short stories, mostly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Authors might include Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov, Gippius, Teffi, Tsvetaeva, Platonov, Bunin, Nabokov, and others.  Some of the questions we explore: Is a short story (rasskaz) just a shorter piece of fiction or does it aim to do something very different from a novel? How did the Russians develop-and maybe change-the genre? In what ways are these stories connected to the place and time in which they were written? We will read one or two short stories a week. This is a Writing Intensive course. No knowledge of Russian is required. All readings are in English translation.",

The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250).  In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

Some contend that memory sites are \"the new lunch counters,\" where our racial politics are worked out. This course examines the racial politics of commemorative objects and practices, and commemorative intervention as a strategy of anti-racist activism. We begin with an historical survey of various ways that racism has been inscribed on the commemorative landscape, and readings in history, political theory, cultural studies, and other fields to gain insight on these contested commemorative objects, their development, and social significance. We then turn to a critical assessment of efforts to remove and recontextualize commemorative objects, and to erect new objects commemorating neglected figures and issues. We consider how these reparative efforts relate to what political theorists call remedies of recognition, and specifically how they might aid in advancing equal opportunity and justice. Through our study and engagement with contested commemorative landscapes, including local, national, and global cases, students will become familiar with the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of memory studies, diverse forms and sites of commemoration, local and global efforts to advance what has been termed \"commemorative justice,\" and challenges they face.",

Part I surveys the late 19th and early 20th century development of the \"parental state\" including its institutional centerpiece (the juvenile court), and principle legal subjects (\"dependents\" and \"delinquents\"), and how these took shape alongside the contemporaneous rise of American Apartheid. Part II examines several key changes and challenges in contemporary juvenile justice, including the transformation of this institution in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, and the endurance of racialized juvenile social control in the post-Civil Rights period. Finally, Part III considers possible futures of youth justice in the United States and beyond, and practical strategies for achieving equal protection within and beyond law.",

We will draw on a range of comparative, historical, and contemporary case studies to explore changes in the ways in which American workers get paid.  Key areas of focus include employer strategies to prevent workers from realizing their market value, to the role Wall St. plays in influencing pay, to ongoing efforts to measure and reward individual productivity.

To reach these goals much research has sought to determine the factors that influence health status beyond health care quality and access. This course explores the broad area of study termed the \"social determinants of health,\" while placing special emphasis on the exploration of health disparities in the United States. We will examine the social conditions that relate to the health of populations with particular attention to how patterns of health vary by social class, race/ethnicity and gender. We will also consider mechanisms that produce and maintain these differences. In addition to sociology, we will draw upon the work of multiple disciplines including, public health, demography, anthropology, public policy, economics, and medicine to understand what makes our populations sick and what might make them better. The class will be taught through an active learning approach, with class discussions, small group work, presentations, and critical writing assignments central to the learning process. Your participation, through reading and in discussions, is essential for both the success of the class and your individual learning.",

        "Course Description": "In this course politics is interpreted broadly to not only include formal policy-making processes, but any situation in which people have to solve a problem or come to a decision. The purpose of this course is to explore the process of (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions influence pedagogies-especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge; (3) how pedagogies translate into specific school programs and practices; (4) how these programs and practices impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities influence ideologies and power dynamics. In doing so, this course considers a variety of key educational institutions and actors at the local, state, and federal levels. This course also considers politics across time, space, and individuals-noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. Additionally, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work towards the common good. Specifically, we explore stories that demonstrate how politics can influence the lived experiences of individuals from various class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identity groups. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e. \"What went wrong?\") to problem solution (\"Where do we go from here?\").",

This course is designed to help sociology Ph.D. students develop a strong base in statistical methods.  Starting from basic math, we build up a foundation for linear regression and its application to causal inference.  We will also learn how to use STATA to conduct replicable and reliable analyses.  The course is focused on the tools needed to do research as a Ph.D. sociologist and draws examples from across the social sciences.  Students can take it both as a first course in linear regression or as a deeper dive into regression than a typical undergraduate sequence.",

        "Course Description": "This course, taught in English, is a foundation for students who will work with linguistically and culturally diverse people in the USA and around the world, whether this work is in the courtroom, hospital, classroom, office and more. The class will help prepare you for the diverse range of twenty-first century occupations that have language and linguistics at their center, including machine learning and translation studies. The class utilizes a survey format and covers both internal and external factors related to language acquisition and language use, such as language and the brain, language aptitude, age, gender, memory, prior knowledge, etc. Theoretical and research dimensions of both linguistics and foreign / second language learning are treated. Corresponding implications of the readings focus on action- on making decisions for language policies and debates around the world that are informed by linguistic and language knowledge. The course is required for the minor in applied linguistics, the PhD in Applied Linguistics, and the graduate certificate in language instruction. This course carries the Social and Behavioral Sciences attribute and can be taken for different majors such as International and Area Studies and Educational Studies. Prereq: Ling 170 is recommended but not required.",

Topics to be discussed in class include universal cognitive operations, individual learner differences, text types and literary forms, literacy and social power, and the extent to which reading and writing are interrelated. Students will discuss how to bridge scientific research in the laboratory to practice and will be involved in St. Louis community outreach projects with refugees and immigrants at the International Institute, where they will create and implement reading and writing activities driven by theory and empirical investigations. Students will take the theory and research they learn and will help meet the local reading and writing needs of a changing population with a variety of backgrounds, values and educational preparations. The course is required for the minor in applied linguistics, the PhD in Applied Linguistics, and the graduate certificate in language instruction.

We will take an interdisciplinary approach to explore how media shape culture and alter the material dimensions of cultural production, dissemination, and consumption, paying special attention to the historical formations of popular culture in rural and urban settings. We will study various print, aural and visual mediascapes and analyze the roles mediation (culture circuits), objects (books, speeches, sound or visual recordings), and practices (production and consumption) play in the formation of identity, community, and everyday experiences of nation, globalization, race, gender, and ethnicity. We will address key concepts, research questions, theories, and methodologies in the fields of media and cultural studies, critical theory, material culture, and popular culture, both in the Hispanic World and globally. This course aims to collectively think about new ways of defining objects of study, connecting media and popular culture, and linking interdisciplinary methodologies to broader research questions across the humanities.",

We will address how the consideration of gender has transformed literary and cultural analysis; in particular, the ways in which scholars of feminist and gender studies have challenged traditional assumptions about how knowledge and subjectivities are produced. The students will come out of the course having acquired: 1) a knowledge of fundamental concepts in feminist and gender studies; 2) an understanding of how feminist/gender studies scholars identify and frame research questions; 3) an introduction to the critical debates related to gender and sexuality; 4) a knowledge of feminist cultural history; 5) the ability to apply relevant concepts in feminist and gender studies to your own research in a historically-grounded fashion.",

This will allow us to examine different histories of displacement, spanning from the early twentieth century to the present. In addition to contextualizing the historical and legal significance of such terms as \"refugee,\" \"asylum,\" \"sanctuary,\" \"non-refoulement,\" or \"forced displacement,\" our discussions will also allow us to engage with the broader meanings of concepts that include hospitality, identity, belonging, and citizenship. A majority of the literary texts on the syllabus stem from the Hispanophone world; all are available in translation.

        "Course Description": "The poor are the \"unseen\" multitudes, the Ku Klux Klan is the \"Invisible Empire,\" W.E.B. Du Bois's African American culture exists \"behind the veil,\" gay men and women come in and out of \"the closet,\" terrorists lie hidden in \"sleeper cells\"-these are just a few of the common visual metaphors used to describe the complex forces and subjects that make up U.S. culture.  Despite its status as metaphor, however, visuality shapes our relationship to American society in very real ways. To become visible in the eyes of the state is to access citizenship, to become a full member of the social world. In this course, we will encounter a variety of cultural texts that figure identity through visibility. From narratives of haunting in U.S. culture to spectacular displays of national identity and accounts of minority groups insisting on the right to be seen, we will look to the moments in American culture when the question of visibility has been most crucial.  The course is arranged thematically and will feature both primary texts as well as classic and contemporary work in the field of American Studies. Possible topics include: the theory and practice of Holy Land tourism in the nineteenth century; antebellum hoax culture; the relationship between lynching and mass media; documentary accounts of natural disasters from the San Francisco earthquake to Hurricane Katrina; queer representation in popular media; the rise and fall of the Vine app; the rhetoric of terrorist \"sleeper cells\"; oppositional mythologies of the \"white working class\" and \"undocumented\" immigrants. The semester will culminate with a discussion of the globalization of American Studies alongside a serial viewing of the first season of the acclaimed drama series, Homeland (2011).\n\nAmerican Culture Studies (AMCS) is a multidisciplinary program that provides both a broader context for study in different fields and a deeper understanding of American culture in all of its complexities.",

        "Course Description": "This course serves as the introductory course analyzing the forces shaping America's cities and surrounding metropolitan areas. It examines as well strategies for dealing with many of the profound social issues affecting urban/metropolitan America.  Emanating from an historical perspective, it examines the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization shaped Northern American cities and the consequences of deindustrialization on urban citizenry. It further surveys the demographic and spatial transformation of American cities examining the consequences of urban transformation on federal, state and local politics, on society and on her institutions. Similarly, the course focuses on the origin and societal changes and emerging goals of urban development, gentrification and evolving patterns of metropolitanism and the necessity for central city as well as neighborhood reconstruction. The dynamics of racial residential segregation, crime and punishment, issues of academic achievement and under-achievement, the social cleavages of urban marginalized communities, family structure, urban homelessness, urban sprawl, and health care, among others, are viewed from the perspective of social justice by exploring social, political, economic, racial, and ethnic factors that impact on access, equity and care. Various theoretical perspectives and philosophies are introduced that have dominated the discourse on race and urban poverty.  A field based component complements the coursework, and is designed to build interest, awareness and skills in preparation for outreach to urban communities.  PREREQUISITE: Sophomore standing.",

Within an era of state standardization and accountability, it is imperative to use a systems approach in education that unites homes, schools, and communities.  Differentiating instruction to meet the needs of all students, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and other traditionally marginalized groups of students, is essential.  This course will introduce students to sociocultural theories of literacy across settings.  It will prepare students to analyze how race, ethnicity, class, gender, and language influence the development of literacy skills. We will develop a multifaceted view of literacy that is embedded within culture and acknowledges the influences of social institutions and conditions. Incorporates strategies for individual student needs based on background and prior experiences to deliver differentiated instruction and teaches students to set learning goals.",

The course will use the latest version of ESRI ArcGIS. The course is taught using a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on, interactive tutorials in the classroom. You will also explore the scientific literature to understand how GIS is being used by various disciplines to address spatial questions. The course takes a multidisciplinary approach that is focused on learning the tools of GIS versus working with data from a particular field. The goal is to establish a solid foundation you can use to address spatial questions that interest you, your mentor, or your employee. The first weeks of the course will provide a broad view of how you can display and query spatial data and produce map products. The remainder of the course will explore the power of GIS with a focus on applying spatial analytical tools to address questions and solve problems. As the semester develops, more tools will be added to your GIS toolbox so that you can complete a final independent project that integrates materials learned during the course with those spatial analyses that interest you the most. Students will have the choice of using a prepared final project, a provided data set, or designing an individualized final project using their own or other available data.",

        "Course Description": "In this course politics is interpreted broadly to not only include formal policy-making processes, but any situation in which people have to solve a problem or come to a decision. The purpose of this course is to explore the process of (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions influence pedagogies-especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge; (3) how pedagogies translate into specific school programs and practices; (4) how these programs and practices impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities influence ideologies and power dynamics. In doing so, this course considers a variety of key educational institutions and actors at the local, state, and federal levels. This course also considers politics across time, space, and individuals-noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. Additionally, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work towards the common good. Specifically, we explore stories that demonstrate how politics can influence the lived experiences of individuals from various class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identity groups. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e. \"What went wrong?\") to problem solution (\"Where do we go from here?\").",

Besides looking at their political and economic lives, students will explore the changing gender roles and relations within marriage and the family, as well as the changing sexual and maternal mores.",

Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series´ departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy. Authors will include Newbery, Alcott, Montgomery, Wilder, Lindgren, L'Engle, and \"Carolyn Keene.\"  Writing Intensive. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

        "Course Description": "Race and sexuality have long been concerns of public health. From hygienic campaigns against Mexican immigrants in early-1900s California to the 1991 quarantine of Haitian refugees with HIV at Guantanamo Bay, race and sexuality have proven crucial to how society identifies health and, by extension, determines who is fit to be a citizen. This interdisciplinary course interrogates the intersections of race, sexuality, and medicine, discussing how each domain has been constitutive of the other in the American context. Via feminist and queer theorizing, we will examine the political and economic factors under which diseases, illnesses, and health campaigns have impacted racial and sexual minorities over the last two centuries. An orienting question for the course is: how has the state wielded public health as a regulatory site to legitimatize perceived racial differences and to regulate ostensible sexual deviations? Through primary and secondary sources, we will likewise explore the various forms of \"health activism\" undertaken by these very same targeted populations. Themes to be addressed will include: the medicalization of racial and sexual difference; activism both in and against health institutions; and the role of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability in contemporary health issues. Case studies include the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, the sterilization of black, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Native American women, the medicalization of homosexuality during the Cold War, and the role of mass incarceration in the diffusion of HIV. At a moment in time when access to health continues to be shaped by categories of social difference, understanding the role of public health in the normalization and subversion of racial and sexual hierarchies in the West is more pertinent than ever.",

The ancient Greeks and Romans had their own ideas - ideas that strike us today as both deeply alien and strikingly familiar. This course will consider questions such as: what constituted \"normal\" sex for the Greeks and for the Romans? What sex acts did they consider to be problematic or illicit, and why? What traits did the Greeks and Romans associate with masculinity? With femininity? How did society treat those who did not quite fit into those categories? How did peoples of the ancient world respond to same-sex and other-sex relationships, and was there an ancient concept of \"sexuality\"? How did issues of class, ethnicity, and age interact with and shape these concepts? How does an understanding of these issues change the way we think about sex and gender today? We will read an array of ancient texts in translation, consider various theoretical viewpoints, and move toward an understanding of what sex and gender meant in the ancient world.",

In this course, we participate in this national project of history-making by helping to excavate the queer past in the greater St. Louis region. Course readings will focus on the ways that sexual identities and communities in the United States have been shaped by urban settings since the late nineteenth century, with particular attention to the ways that race, class and gender have structured queer spaces and communities. We will pay particular attention to these processes in the St. Louis region. As part of their community-engaged learning, students will complete an oral history interview with a St. Louis LGBTQ+ community member and otherwise contribute to preserving  LGBTQ+ history in the St. Louis region.  We end the semester with a party celebrating the folks who have contributed to our oral history project.  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a community-engaged learning class, which means it combines classroom learning with work in the community. In addition to regular class time, plan to spend an additional 3-5 hours a week on community-engaged learning. Before beginning community service students must complete required training.

        "Course Description": "For many, \"disability\" seems like a concept with a relatively stable definition and a fairly straightforward relationship to questions of health and well-being. But in the past few decades, scholars and activists have begun to challenge the notion that disability is a tragedy to be medically prevented or inspirationally \"overcome.\"  These scholars have instead focused their attention on the social aspects of disability: how it came to be constructed as a category of identity, the physical and institutional barriers that have excluded disabled people from public life, and the distortion of disabled lives within the mainstream representation.  More recently, writers have turned their attention to the way disability had been defined though norms of race, gender, and sexuality.  These intersections will be the focus of this course.  From the diagnoses of hysteria, to debates over selective abortion, the recent proliferation of breast cancer memoirs, we will consider how the politics of disability has both complemented and complicated the usual goals of feminism.  We will also explore some of the ways that disability studies as a discipline has redefined, and in turn been shaped by, the fields of queer theory, masculinity studies, and critical race theory.  We will consider how deviant genders have been the target of medicalization,   the relationship between \"corrective surgery\" and compulsory gendering, the desexualization and hypersexualization of disabled bodies, and the role that medicine has played in justifying colonial conquest and perpetuating racial inequalities.

        "Course Description": "This course (formerly called \"Women and the Law\") explores how social constructions of gender, race, class, and sexuality have shaped traditional legal reasoning and American legal concepts, including women's legal rights.  We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty.

We read one of the best selling novels of the century, one that created a scandal and ruined the author's literary reputation, along with others that have garnered more attention in our time than their own.  In addition to focusing on these women writers, we also explore questions about the canon and American literature:  What makes literature \"good\"?  What constitutes American literature?  How does an author get in the canon and stay there?  Finally, in this writing intensive course, there are frequent writing assignments and a strong emphasis on the essential writing process of drafting and revising.",

Rather than devote our time to dispel stereotypes, in this course, we address the extent to which Western theories of feminism are useful to account for Muslim women's experiences across historical period and geographical region. By examining discourses of gender, sexuality, the ideals of the feminine and masculine in Islamic scriptures and jurisprudence, and\nsubsequent encounters with Western imperialism, we investigate how gender informs social, political, religious, and family life in Islamic cultures. We employ a chronological approach to these topics, beginning with the status of women in seventh century Arabia, to the period of Islamic expansion across Asia, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the colonial period ending with the contemporary post 9/11 and post 2016 US contexts, wherein debates over the status of Muslim women in society emerge with renewed vigor. \n",

To interrogate how conceptions of the \"ideal worker\" are gendered, sexualized and racialized, we will engage scholarship on affective and emotional labor; domestic and reproductive labor; migrant domestic work; neoliberalism and service economies; feminism and racial capitalism; sex work; disability justice; and feminist anti-work politics. Additionally, we will ask what is \"new\" about neoliberal capitalism, and how the relationship between citizenship, the state and the \"ideal worker\" has morphed in distinctly gendered and racialized ways over time. As part of this effort, we will engage feminist political theory that interrogates the relationship between radical democracy, justice and the market, drawing from Marxist feminist, liberal feminist, radical feminist, decolonial feminist and Black feminist thought. In the latter part of the semester we will examine how these various feminist approaches to work have addressed issues such as solidarity and organizing; legalization of sex work; the wages for housework campaign; internationalism; anti-racism and anti-capitalism; labor outsourcing; alternative economies; and US imperialism.Prerequisite: Introduction to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (L77 100B).",

        "Course Description": "This course is interested in the ways ordinary people break rules, flout norms, and make trouble. We know that resistance manifests in social movements, militant activism, and direct confrontation, but it also comes through quieter acts of unruliness and non-compliance. Looking at power 'from below,' readings focus on everyday interventions in systems of control. Garment workers threaten \"good pay or bum work,\" queers \"fail\" at reproductive heterosexuality, and shiftless people steal moments of leisure from a system that wants us either productive or dead. These acts may not be obviously political, but because people at the margins have so often been left outside (and also opt out) of formal politics, subtle resistance is particularly interesting for feminist and queer scholars. \n\nEveryday acts do threaten the status quo-otherwise, why would they be so rigidly policed? But questions remain. Throughout the semester, we'll ask: What counts as resistance? What are its ethics? When is a bad attitude an act of rebellion, and does it matter if that rebellion is conscious? Does survival constitute resistance for those not meant to survive? On the other hand, for those subjects whose active engagement sustains the status quo, is withdrawal the more radical choice? Does the refusal of sociality constitute a form of resistance? Or, are there ways to forge communities of mutual care that erode the status quo rather than reproduce it? \nPrerequisite:  L77 110B Intro to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies or by permission of instructor.\n",

Students will explore the relationship between local communities and wider historical and economic processes, and theoretical approaches to disease, the body, ethnicity/race, gender, sexuality, risk, addiction, power, and culture.  Other topics covered include the cultural construction of AIDS and risk, government responses to HIV/AIDS, origin and transmission debates, ethics and responsibilities, drug testing and marketing, the making of the AIDS industry and \"risk\" categories, prevention and education strategies, interaction between bio-medicine and alternative healing systems, and medical advances and hopes.",

        "Course Description": "Research is the foundation of academic knowledge and of much knowledge produced outside of the academy in think tanks, non-profit organizations, social service agencies, corporations, and many other venues of economic and social activity.  Informed by theory, and shaped by specific methods, research can and does help to frame problems, contribute to policymaking, and evaluate the effectiveness of policies and programs. Research is employed in a variety of ways in the different disciplines within the academy and within different practices outside of the academy. This course examines the different ways in which research is conducted and examines the reasons for these differences and the ways in which they contribute to or hamper feminist goals. The course also explores the ways in which some research methods are privileged over others in hegemonic understandings of what counts as \"research\" and of what counts as \"knowledge.\" The course examines how gender theory and feminist politics shape the kinds of research questions researchers ask, the types of materials and other information researchers use, and the ways researchers define our relationships with our sources of data, evidence, and other information. Students are expected to reflect on and engage with feminist approaches to research in this course in order to develop and complete a detailed research proposal.  Prerequisite: At least 2 courses in WGSS, including Introduction to WGSS or Sexuality Studies at the 100 or 200-levels and one 300-level WGSS course, preferably in feminist or queer theory.

S. modernism in works by and about Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, Willa Cather, Zora Neale Hurston, and Marianne Moore. We will consider especially the emergence of the biographical and literary \"New Woman\" as a character type and as a social reality. Beginning with Wharton's reimagining of national and gender identity in \"The House of Mirth\" (1905) and \"The Age of Innocence\" (1920), we will read Stein's \"Three Lives (1909); Cather's \"My Ántonia\" (1913) and \"Sapphira and the Slave Girl\" (1940); Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937); and selected poems by Marianne Moore such as her satire \"Marriage\" (1923). Modernist literary women tried to imagine freer social roles for themselves, their characters or personae, and their readers. But to what extent was biographical and social experience aesthetic fate, and how does nostalgia function in this period? There will be a midterm paper, a final paper, and a formal oral report. Faithful attendance and class participation are required, naturally! Graduate students will have extra responsibilities, to be discussed at our first class meeting.

To uncover how different feminist theories have been adopted in the struggle for political transformation and social justice, we will pursue two main lines of inquiry. The first asks how feminist thinkers from various traditions critique and engage the history of political thought within the social contract\ntradition. We will ask, in particular, how gender, race, slavery, colonialism and empire shape conceptions of citizenship and property. We will also examine transnational feminist critiques of the public/private division in the Western political theory canon as it impacts the role of women and the social construction of women's bodies. During the second half of the semester, we will ask how various transnational social movements have engaged and adopted feminist theories in efforts to resist state violence, colonialism, labor exploitation and resource extraction. In following\nthese lines of inquiry we will draw from postcolonial, decolonial, liberal, Black, radical, Marxist and Chicana feminist perspectives. Part of our goal will be to uncover how various feminist theories treat the relationship between politics and embodied experience, how gendered conceptions of family life affect notions of political power and how ideas about sexuality and sexual conquest intersect with empire-building.

In this transdisciplinary course, students take gender seriously as an analytical category and examine how masculinities, femininities, gender identities, and sexualities shape the construction, implementation, and outcomes of global governance, politics, economics, and interventions. \nTraversing macro and micro levels, the course exposes students to diverse voices from around the world, which they utilize to conduct gender analyses on case studies relevant to their interests. Throughout, we will be mindful of 1) how gender functions in tandem with sexuality, class, race, religion, and ethnicity (intersectionality) and 2) how multidimensional identities morph historically, regionally, and culturally. The student builds a gender analysis toolkit and practices what Cynthia Enloe describes as \"feminist curiosity,\" exploring the relationship between gender and power in various aspects of international affairs.",

Beginning with the successful writer Fanny Lewald, who initially cringed at the very thought of earning money, and concluding with Vicki Baum and Irmgard Keun who succeeded on the postwar Weimar market, we will examine examples of novels, short stories, books for children, poetry, autobiographical writing, essays, and other genres by women; the venues in which these works were published; the circumstances that made this writing possible; the forces that opposed it; and the degree to which literature by women was included in contemporary conceptions of \"national literature.\"  We will pay special attention to the book industry and the expansion of readership by women and girls, whose own lives were changing as they emerged from the confines of nineteenth-century domesticity and gained new access to work, study, commerce and consumption, and politics. Select readings in gender theory and women's history will help to provide a critical apparatus with which to interpret and evaluate this work. Readings in German and English. Discussion in English.",

Readings and assignments are designed to enhance students' awareness of the relationship between writing and their observations and experiences of the visual world.

        "Course Description": "The study of rhetoric, one of the original seven Liberal Arts, is perhaps more relevant today, in a world where diverse opinions reverberate 24/7 from television and the internet, than in ancient times when rhetors invented arguments to help people choose the best course of action when they disagreed about important political, religious, or social issues.  How do we make our voices heard?  How can we invent and present compelling written discourse.  \nThis course will introduce students to common rhetorical principles and to the disciplinary history of rhetoric and compositional studies.  Assignments in this class include rhetorical exercise in invention and craft, imitations, and varied compositions, ranging from the personal to critical, from the biographical to argumentative.  We will examine rhetorical principles (audience, context, kairos, exigency, ethos, pathos, logos, and so forth) that are employed, for example, not only in literary analysis but in law, politics, education, and science.  We will aim for a mastery of craft and a refinement of thought. Pre-Req: Writing 1. This course does not count toward the Creative Writing Concentration.",

Patients have been writing not only about what it feels like to be ill, but also about the ways doctors have both helped and failed them. We will read a sample of these works by physicians, patients, and journalists, drawing from a list that includes Gawande, Sacks, Ofri, Chen, Selzer, Kalanithi, Groopman, Mukherjee, Sweet, Elliott, Jamison, Ehrenreich, Sontag, Hillenbrand, O'Rourke, Trillin, Mairs, Hemon, Specter, Tisdale, Keefe, and Khatchadourian. In this writing-centered class, we will focus on how, why, and how well physicians and patients make written arguments to the public. Writing assignments will allow students to work on the matter of how best to represent illness, and to improve their skills in analysis and argumentation. Peer review sessions will encourage substantive revision. This course does not count toward the Creative Writing Concentration, but creative writers are most welcome.",

However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.

Writers will explore the various elements, structures and styles used in crafting a motion picture screenplay.  They will experience this process as they conceive, develop and execute the first act of a feature-length script.  Writers will create a screenplay story, present an outline for class discussion and analysis,  then craft Act One.  Writers will be encouraged to consult with the instructor at various stages: concept, outline, character and scene development and dialogue execution.  While the students fashion their screenwriting independently, the class will also explore the general elements of THEME, GENRE, and VOICE.  A more specific examination of mechanics, the nuts and bolts of story construction, plotting, pacing, etc. will follow to support the ongoing writing process.  In-class exercises will aid the writer in sharpening skills and discovering new approaches to form and content.  Writers' work will be shared and discussed regularly in class.  Screening of film scenes and sequences will provide students with concrete examples of how dramatic screenwriting evolves once it leaves the writer's hands.",

In its real-life context, writing always interacts with a community in some way, engaging a defined audience to produce an intended effect. In this sense, writing always touches the affairs of a polis, and thus, writing is inherently political, regardless of whether the writer considers this during composition. In this class, we will focus on explicitly political writing by writers who are not politicians, that is to say, sanctioned experts in the affairs of the polis. Foregoing public policy memoranda and economic analyses, we will look at how journalists, grassroots organizers, and creative writers have consciously written to intervene in the affairs of their communities despite their outsider status. Using techniques of rhetorical analysis and logical structure, we will examine how these writers crafted works that inspire and move audiences through the conventions of several genres: essay, polemic, journalism, and satire. While doing my major advising this morning, I noticed that we've got another rhetoric class that doesn't have the tagline. This course does not count toward the Creative Writing Concentration.",

We will read and discuss a selection of texts that assist us in asking (for example): what might a queer, Black, feminist, or Indigenous ecopoetics look like? How do formal choices generate (and how are they generated by) these and other convergences? Etymologically, the term ecopoetics implies an idea or practice of making home, coming from the Greek OIKOS, translated as \"family,\" \"property,\" or \"house,\" and POIESIS, translated as \"to make.\" Given the profound and widespread contestation of notions of home at this moment of global cultural and climate crisis, ecopoetics expands to encompass myriad questions of material belonging. How do poetic forms, modes, and techniques grapple with and shape these explorations, whether in a single poem or in book-length works? We will likely read texts by Juliana Spahr, Gloria Anzaldúa, Inger Christensen, Camille T. Dungy, Tommy Pico, Jos Charles, CAConrad, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Ariana Reines, Patricia Smith, and others. Over the course of the semester, students will work toward the completion of their own poetry chapbooks through class prompts, workshops, and revision.

For the survey aspect, we'll read book reviews to manifestos to book-length poetic-critical hybrids. The goal is not really compare-and-contrasting but rather considering each form within its rhetorical context and seeing what we can learn. We might look at how a single writer handles various subjects, and at how various writers handle a single subject. Writers we have read in past years, and are likely to read this semester, include Susan Howe, James Baldwin, Dave Hickey, Anne Carson, William Carlos Williams, Carl Phillips, Susan Sontag, James Wood, Maggie Nelson, Oscar Wilde, Maureen N. McLane, and Renee Gladman. We will definitely read Roland Barthes. This course counts toward the Creative Writing Concentration.",

Students can apply in the spring of their first year, to begin the internship the following fall. The intern chosen will work directly with Marty Riker, the press's publisher, on mutually agreed upon projects that take into account the intern's interests and strengths. In general, however, the internship is designed to give students a wide range of experience with literary publishing, and so will likely involve a mix of editorial tasks (e.g., reviewing submissions, writing reader's reports, copyediting manuscripts in layout), marketing, design, and book production and distribution. The intern will also have opportunities to represent the press publicly, including at the annual AWP conference (travel and hotel expenses will be covered), and his or her name will appear on the press's masthead. Interested students should submit a letter of application and CV to Professor Riker (mriker@wustl.edu) and Program Director David Schuman (dschuman@wustl.edu) no later than March 15 of the spring semester of their first year.

        "Course Description": "Unoriginal Genius, which borrows its title and inspiration from the Marjorie Perloff book, will be a craft course devoted to reading and writing various forms of intertextual fiction involving appropriation. We'll consider a wide variety of contemporary fiction (as well as some poetry and perhaps a play or two) under four headings, which we'll define and refine: elaborations, interpretations, assemblies, and uncreative writing. We'll also draw connections to appropriation theory and practice in the visual arts, and we'll discuss evolving notions of authorship and personal expression in a contemporary, digital landscape. Authors will likely include Kate Bernheimer, Jorge Luis Borges, Anne Carson, Angela Carter, Lydia Davis, Kate Durbin, Kenneth Goldsmith, John Keene, Carmen Maria Machado, Srikanth Reddy, Jean Rhys, Sofia Samatar, Tom Stoppard, and Sara Uribe. But this will be a writing course, first and foremost, with creative assignments and workshops throughout the semester.",

        "Course Description": "In some ways, the memoir blitz that began in the 1990s created a mistaken notion that writing about the self is a modern invention. The contemporary memoir may be a modern invention of the publishing industry (hypotheses abound that it was partly borne of a marketing ploy to deal with the abundance of autobiographical first novels being written by graduates of MFA programs at the time), but writing about the self has a solid history behind it. While this course will begin with and focus on the contemporary memoir, we will also consider its precursors and look at examples that chart the history of autobiographical writing from its beginnings as confessions through its longstanding era as autobiography to its current moment as memoir. We will read contemporary memoirs representing all the major subcategories of the genre, including coming of age memoirs, memoirs of illness and trauma, travel memoirs, occupational memoirs, memoirs about family, and experimental memoirs. To consider the differences that occur when one writes about the self as a fictional construct versus a nonfictional one, we will also look at some contemporary memoirs that were originally published as novels and rewritten and republished decades later as memoirs. Throughout the semester students will write short works of memoir aimed at generating material for potential book-length works. Open only to students in the MFA program.",
